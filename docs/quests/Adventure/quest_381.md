# Quest [Undersea Devil] Details


### Quest [Undersea Devil] Details

  | Attribute | Details |  
  | :--- | :--- |  
  | **Quest Name** | devil under the sea |  

### Quest Contents
There are many kinds of devil fish, such as octopus and squid. However, apparently there are "devil fish" in tropical seas that can't be compared to octopuses. I would like to request an investigation into that. I heard it was seen in the Atlantic Ocean, so ask about it in Algin.
