  | Attribute | Details |

  | **Quest Name** | eastern bay of india |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a request to investigate the topography of eastern India in order to determine a shipping route. The sea in that area gets very rough depending on the season and can be dangerous. It can be dangerous if you don't prepare a detailed map. Areas where rivers flow into the area are especially dangerous. Please focus on the hollow area of ​​the bay.
