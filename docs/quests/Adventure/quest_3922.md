| **Quest Name** | Island Constellation |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. There's a constellation shaped like Sicily, so I'd like you to look it up. Sicily is an island in the Mediterranean Sea. I'm sure there was a city called Syracuse. I think there's someone out there who knows something.

Although it is a small constellation with no bright stars, it is easy to distinguish because there are no bright stars around it.
