| **Quest Name** | Crimson Bird |  

### Quest Contents
A biologist has asked me to research birds that live in the Hawaiian Islands. It is said to be about the size of a sparrow and has a distinctive curved red beak. Apparently, the crimson feathers of this bird are prized as accessories for the ruling class, so I don't think it would be that difficult to gather information locally. Listen to what the residents have to say
