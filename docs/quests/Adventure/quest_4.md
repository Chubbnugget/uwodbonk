### Quest [Rumors of Avignon] Details

  | Attribute | Details |  
  | :--- | :--- |  
  | **Quest Name** | Rumors of Avignon |  

### Quest Contents
A request came from a church in Marseille. Lately, there have been a lot of ominous events happening in the city of Marseille, and it seems that there is a lot of fuss about them being cursed by the "Knight". It seems like they want us to find out the truth and solve the problem... but I wonder if this is also my job.
