### Details of the quest [Investigation in the Canary Islands]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Survey of the Canary Islands |  

### Quest Contents
There is a city called Las Palmas on the Canary Islands off the southwest coast of Iberia. My request is to find out if it's possible to build cities on other islands in the archipelago. Small islands like that often have volcanoes. If you don't research carefully in advance, you'll be in trouble. Look around me at the tavern in Las Palmas.
