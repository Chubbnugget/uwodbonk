If you know anything about chimpanzees, I have a request just for you. This is a request from a scholar in this city, but apparently there are monkeys in the New World that are as intelligent as chimpanzees. I'm asking you to research about that monkey.Would you please do that? If you don't mind, please hear from the client.
