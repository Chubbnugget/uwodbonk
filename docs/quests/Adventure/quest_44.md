| **Quest Name** | Islamic culture crafts |  

### Quest Contents
Have you done any research on Arabian culture? I've received a request to do some research on Arabian craft techniques. Because of the power of the Ottoman Turks, wealth and technology were concentrated in Arabia. It would be a good idea to consult the Muscat workshop craftsmen first.
