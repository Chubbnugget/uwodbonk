| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | An island where culture gathers |  

### Quest Contents
Did you know that there is an island between Nagasaki and Manila? The island can be said to be a trading hub with the Ming Dynasty, Japan, and Korea. Trade with Java and Ayutthaya was also active, but I haven't heard of it recently. It seems that a merchant who wants to trade with that island again wants to know the circumstances around it. First, collect information in Manila.
