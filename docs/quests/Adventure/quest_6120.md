### Quest Contents
Dragon blood is very expensive around here, but recently I heard that something similar can be obtained on the islands around Madeira. A trader wants to know how it compares to dragon blood from Socotra. Could you please actually go to Madeira and investigate?

| **Notes** | 1. Madeira Tavern Master 2. Las Palmas Tavern Trader 3. Ecology survey on the northwest coast of Africa, 17m east and 17m north of the large rock in the southeast *One road south of the central plaza. *The premise is that there is only Socotra, but even if Socotra has been discovered, it may not be possible to introduce it. (Not experience) * Socotra has a Discovery with the same name for geography and town, so it is impossible to distinguish from the prerequisite information of Socotra, additional information is required * Socotra is found in Discovery for ports/villages and geography. It was not possible to introduce a character who has discovered both Socotra to a character who has not yet discovered Geography, but since it became possible to introduce it after discovering Geography Socotra, it seems likely that both Socotra or Geography Socotra will be introduced. →It seems to be confirmed based on the Geographical Discovery “Sokotra” premise. |
