| **Quest Name** | Landscape of Ancient Greece |  

### Quest Contents
I heard you went to see the Olympia ruins. The ruins are famous because they are even mentioned in Pausanias' Guide to Greece. I received a request to find a guide to Greece that was as close to the original as possible, so I thought I'd ask you. Check it out in Athens.
