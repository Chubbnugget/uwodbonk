| **Quest Name** | Beautiful Knight |  

### Quest Contents
I can't reveal his name, but it's a request from a certain famous admiral. Apparently there was once a knight who led a large army and fought against Rome as a woman, and I would like you to find out more about her. If Naples is close to Rome, there might be some clues.
