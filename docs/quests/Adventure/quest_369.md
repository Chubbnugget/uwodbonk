| **Quest Name** | Gentle Emperor |  

### Quest Contents
Do you know the Five Wise Emperors of Rome? These are the five emperors who created a particularly prosperous period in the long history of ancient Rome. The fourth one among them? I've been asked to find the relics of an emperor named Antonius Pius. Since he was an emperor who never left Rome, it would be a good idea to ask a Neapolitan scholar.
