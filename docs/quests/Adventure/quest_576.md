### Details of the quest [Cat that gives birth to perfume]

| **Quest Name** | cat that gives birth to spices |  

### Quest Contents
Do you know the fragrance called civet? It's a fragrance that comes from a certain type of cat, and it's ridiculously expensive. But it seems like it's hard to find. Apparently it has been caught several times around Massawa, so I'd like you to check it out. If you ask at the rest area over there, you'll probably find out something.
