### Details of the quest [Picture on the rock wall]

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | rock wall painting |  

### Quest Contents
This request comes from a trader in a rest area here in Aden, but... it's a bit strange. It seems like they want me to find the location of a certain mural, but their purpose is to "erase the mural"... Anyway, since I heard it was a mural, I introduced it to you, who has experience investigating murals. Please ask me if you feel like it.
