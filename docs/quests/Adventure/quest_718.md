### Quest Contents
I heard you found a stone tablet from Mesopotamia. I've received a request from a certain scholar in anticipation of your skills. He wants me to look into the old literature of Mesopotamia. This is difficult because I'm asked to bring in a story about when the country began to prosper in Mesopotamia... First, gather information at the bar.
