| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Indian bird constellation |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. Did you know that the development of navigation technology created constellations in the southern sky that cannot be seen in Europe? Apparently there is a constellation based on Indian birds, and they want you to find it. Wouldn't it be a good idea to interview people around Goa?
