### Quest Contents
Your report on the four seasons at the edge of the east was very well received. The client was overjoyed because he found The Pillow Book interesting. So, could you please ask me to do one more investigation? It seems like this time it's about the love situation. The client is said to be an aspiring writer, so I guess he will use this as a reference for his new work. I'll ask you again from Nagasaki.
