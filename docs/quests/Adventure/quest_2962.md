### Quest Contents
It seems that a sailor in this town has brought back some strange stories, and the scholars are intrigued. I don't know the details either, but it seems to be a story about a certain plant that lives in the land north of the Caribbean. The request is to confirm the truth of the story. Just ask the sailor.
