# Details of the quest [Delivery of herring]


### Details of the quest [Delivery of herring]

  | Attribute | Details |  
  | :--- | :--- |  
  | **Quest Name** | Herring delivery |  

### Quest Contents
I received a request from a workshop in Lisbon to deliver three barrels of herring. I guess they are in trouble these days due to poor fishing. You can catch herring pretty much anywhere around here, so it's an easy job. Thank you for your help.
