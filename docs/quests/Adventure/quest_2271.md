# Quest [Sweet Scent of Invitation]


### Quest [Sweet Scent of Invitation] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Sweet Scent of Invitation |  

### Quest Contents
How about investigating the ruins of Pompeii? This was a request from a local research team, but as they were investigating, they noticed a sweet smell coming from everywhere, and apparently they were getting hungry. I can't find anything that seems to be the source of the scent, so I wonder what's going on. Could you please do some questioning in Guam?
