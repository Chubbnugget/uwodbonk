### Quest Contents
This is a request from a town official in Sofala. Apparently there's a place in that area where the trees suddenly start to sway at night. Rumor has it that there are creatures rampaging in the trees, or that it is the work of evil spirits. Talk to the town official in Sofala and find out his true identity.
