### Details of the quest [Security in the Western Sea Area]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Security in the western sea area |  

### Quest Contents
It's been a while since the waters to the west opened up, but the security seems to be poor, perhaps because it's hard for surveillance from home to reach. We have received a request to investigate the geography of the western sea area in order to suppress pirates. Ask the port official in Santo Domingo where there are particularly many pirates and compile them on a map.
