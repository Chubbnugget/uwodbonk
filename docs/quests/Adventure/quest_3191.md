### Quest Contents
You've been eyeing the island as a "land of grapes," but if you can confirm that it really is, it'll be a great discovery and a dream-like accomplishment! However, since the only thing that can be proven is tradition, I would like something a little more. The scholars in question also asked for conclusive evidence that would make no sound.
