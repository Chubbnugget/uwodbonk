### Quest Contents
This was a request from a family who loves snakes. I want to give my son a cool snake. Well, that's an unbelievable story... Well, if you don't hate snakes, why don't you try looking for them? I heard that the proprietor of a tool shop in Sierra Leone deals with animals, so you should talk to him about it.
