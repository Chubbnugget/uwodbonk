| **Quest Name** | Things that shouldn't be on land |  

### Quest Contents
It's a bit unpleasant, though. Apparently, there's been a bit of a stir over the discovery of petrified shark bones in Africa. And it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal... Could you please check it out? Apparently it was found near Abidjan. Ask me at the bar.

The teeth are clearly visible, but other than that, only traces remain. This is probably because sharks have soft bones. Anyway, why was this huge shark bone (quest_972.md) discovered on land?
