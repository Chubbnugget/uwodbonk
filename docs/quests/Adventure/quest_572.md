### Quest [Vast Ocean] Details

  | Attribute | Details |  
  | :--- | :--- |  
  | **Quest Name** | vast ocean |  

### Quest Contents
The sea to the south of India has long been a trading route for ships. I've received a request to investigate the ocean currents and seasonal winds there. If you look out over the ocean from the southernmost tip of India, you'll get a general idea. It seems like there will be terrible storms from time to time, so be careful.
