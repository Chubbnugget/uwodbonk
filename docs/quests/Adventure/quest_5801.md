# Details of the quest [What to explore]


### Details of the quest [What to explore]

| **Quest Name** | What to explore |  

### Quest Contents
It seems that a new huge ruin has been discovered to the east. I would like you to investigate. It's so vast that you don't know where to start looking, so you might want to ask someone who knows more about it. Apparently there's a guy at Oxford University who loves exploring ruins. Maybe he can give you some good advice.
