### Quest Contents
It would be amazing to be able to run on water. I thought it would be impossible for me to do that, but then I learned that I was in the Caribbean. A running lizard. This seems like a lie, so I'd like someone with knowledge of biology to look into it. Ask me at a bar in San Juan.
