### Details of the quest [Giant island south of Manila]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Giant island south of Manila |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. It seems that they want information on the islands near Manila, especially the large island south of Manila. There are a lot of islands in that area, and the shipping routes are complicated, so I don't think it takes someone as skilled as you to help.どうだ、やってもらえるかい？
