### Quest Contents
You found the ruins of Chichen Itza, right? The scholars changed their eyes and started investigating the ruins. Still, we don't have enough manpower, so we end up asking adventurers to investigate while they're exploring. It's a huge ruin. I would like to ask you to investigate as well. Please talk to the city officials.
