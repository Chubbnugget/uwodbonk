### Quest Contents
You know what an antelope is, you know a lot about biology. When I thought of antelopes, I thought they lived in savannahs and rocky areas, but I heard they also live in forests. He might be a bit rare, so I'd like you to look into it, what do you think? Try gathering information in Abidjan.
