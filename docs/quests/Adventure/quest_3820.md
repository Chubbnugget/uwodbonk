### Quest Contents
Since you've been doing a lot of research on pirates, I have some information for you. Lately, there have been rumors in the Caribbean about the location of treasure hidden by a late great pirate. If you want to hear more details, the best place to go is to go to that noisy Port Royal... If you're ready, go.
