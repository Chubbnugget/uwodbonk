### Quest Contents
I've received a request from Mr. Nzinga Nkwa of this town to do a plant survey. It seems like they want me to look into something called "King's Flower," but I wonder what it is. Judging from the name, I can't help but think it's a pretty impressive flower. For now, please ask the person himself for details.
