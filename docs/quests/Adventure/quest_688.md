| **Quest Name** | True Southernmost Point |  

### Quest Contents
You researched the Cape of Good Hope before. At that time, they should have mainly investigated the weather, such as storms and wind conditions. This time it's a topographical survey. Some say that the Cape of Good Hope that Admiral Diaz arrived at is not the southernmost tip of Africa. I want to see if it's true. Please ask the admiral first.
