### Quest Contents
Don't you want to know what paradise on earth is like? A sea as blue and clear as a sapphire, and a sandy beach as white as a pearl... It is said that such an island is floating somewhere in the Caribbean Sea. If the route was to go to the New World, it would have to pass through the Azores first. It would be a good idea to gather information at the bar there.
