| **Quest Name** | Statue of an animal with a pouch on its belly |  

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a biologist. Apparently there are many statues of deified animals in Mesoamerica, and people would definitely like to get their hands on one. Come to think of it, I heard that there is a statue that looks like an opossum near Veracruz. Why not look for clues locally?
