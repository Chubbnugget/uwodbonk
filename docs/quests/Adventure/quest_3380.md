### Quest Contents
I've heard rumors that you discovered Ur. It seems that scholars here in Calicut also heard the rumor and became interested in it. He says he has something he would like to ask of you. I think it's probably a request to investigate a ruin similar to Ur... Well, in any case, please listen to the details from the person himself.
