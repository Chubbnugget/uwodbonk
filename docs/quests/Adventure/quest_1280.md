### Quest Contents
It was a request from the military of a certain country. Not long ago, it seems that there was a king who was so active that he was called the god of war. I would like you to do some research on that person. It seems like it's gaining popularity in the north from here. Why not ask the owner of the rest stop in Malacca?
