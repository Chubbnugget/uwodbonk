### Quest Contents
I got some interesting information from a certain thread. On the way to Taiwan, he stopped at an island where he found strange rocks and caves. The guild is currently acquiring information about that island. I've heard that Takehiro in Tamsui has some useful information, but would you like to look for it too?
