  | **Quest Name** | The land where the king returns |  

### Quest Contents
You've come to the right place. In fact, a scholar in Calicut discovered a strange clay tablet. When I asked a person familiar with the literature, it seems that it is about Alexander the Great. It seems you know a lot about the Great King, so go and listen to his story. It might be valuable information.
