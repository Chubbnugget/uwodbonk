### Quest Contents
This was a request from a map craftsman. Well, he's a young guy who says, ``I'm going to be a craftsman that's a little different from other craftsmen!'' He asked me to know the details of the Isthmus of Cairo and Suez. I think it would be nice if there was a river or something like that... For now, head to Alexandria.
