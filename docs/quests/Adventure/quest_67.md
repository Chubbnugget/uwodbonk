  | **Quest Name** | indian serpent |  

### Quest Contents
There are big snakes in Africa, but I hear there are even bigger and thicker snakes in India. I want you to investigate that snake. They say it's not poisonous, but even if it's not poisonous, there's no way it would kill people, so be careful. You might want to check it out in Calicut.
