# Quest [Caesar's Sword] Details


### Quest [Caesar's Sword] Details

  | Attribute | Details |

  | **Quest Name** | caesar's sword |  

### Quest Contents
I've received some interesting information. Apparently there's a sword that Caesar used. Caesar is also closely related to the Celts you are researching. There may be some interesting material left. Speaking of Caesar... It would be a good idea to visit the archives on the Italian peninsula.
