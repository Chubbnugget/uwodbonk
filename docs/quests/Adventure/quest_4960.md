### Quest Contents
Come to think of it, you've found a lot of turtles so far, haven't you? I've received a request from you to find another turtle. The turtle I want you to look for this time is the one with a mosaic pattern on its shell. Why not visit Basra, where the history of mosaics is said to have begun?
