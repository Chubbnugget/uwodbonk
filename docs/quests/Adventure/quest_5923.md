| **Quest Name** | Painter's detailed handiwork |  

### Quest Contents
Apparently, when a certain aristocratic lady was a child, she had a famous painter make a portrait of her. Lately, it seems like he's wanted to get other prints by the same artist. It seems that the painter has lived in Venice for a long time, so I would like you to ask around the city and find him.
