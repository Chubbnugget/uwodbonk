### Quest Contents
Do you know Flanders? It's about the area around Antwerp. There is an art dealer there, and he has a reputation in some quarters for his good paintings. However, it seems that he draws it as a hobby, so he doesn't sell it. He wants to get his hands on it, so he wants me to look into it. Please try to gather information in Antwerp.
