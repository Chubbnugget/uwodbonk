### Quest Contents
Apparently there are other large birds in Aotearoa besides the eagle you found. It is much larger than other pigeons of its kind around here, and is said to be a big eater. I hear it can be seen around Whanganui. Find out more about that in Whanganui.

| **Discovery** | [Birds](Categories/category_12.md) / [Kereru](Quests/Other/quest_3391.md) A type of pigeon that lives throughout Aotearoa, also known as the wood pigeon. Legend has it that the demigod hero Maui often transformed into this bird. It has a large body and a voracious appetite, so much so that it can swallow fruit whole, but it is said that it sometimes gets drunk after eating fermented fruit.
