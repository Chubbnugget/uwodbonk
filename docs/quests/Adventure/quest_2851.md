| **Quest Name** | Sericulture and silkworm flora |  

### Quest Contents
You were the one who gave me the silkworm report. Apparently, when a certain businessman researched sericulture, he came across a person named Seribusa. However, there seems to be a lack of information. We are looking for people to continue the investigation locally. Would you like to investigate? I'm sure they were cultivating sericulture on Mt. Untaesan.
