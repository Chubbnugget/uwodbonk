### Details of the quest [A Knight's Tale of England]

  | Attribute | Details |  
  | :--- | :--- |  
  | **Quest Name** | knight's tale of england |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a nobleman who is interested in old stories. The man loves stories about knights, and seems to be doing a lot of research on them. This time, I have received a request for a story about an English knight. It seems like you want to read something as close to the original text as possible, so go to the London archives and look for Knight's Tale.
