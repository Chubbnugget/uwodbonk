### Details of the quest [The Hall Buried in the Cliff]

| **Quest Name** | A temple buried in a cliff |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a strange request from someone traveling in Sakai. I heard that there is a building buried in a cliff in the north of Edo. It seems they want you to find out what it is. The fact that it was buried in a cliff made me wonder if it had been hit by a natural disaster... For now, please hear directly from the client in Sakai.
