Apparently a geologist in the Gulf of Guinea got some interesting information from a sailor from San Juan. Apparently there's a bay north of the Caribbean where monsters live... What do you think? Aren't you intrigued? The client himself seems to be busy with research in the Gulf of Guinea, so please do the research in San Juan instead.
