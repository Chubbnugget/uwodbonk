  | **Quest Name** | ancient european peoples |

I've received a request from a scholar who is researching history. Many ethnic groups have lived in Europe since ancient times, but there seems to be a lack of written information about these ethnic groups. Go to the archives in Marseille and search the collection for related descriptions.
