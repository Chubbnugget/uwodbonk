# Details of the quest [Missionary's whereabouts]


### Details of the quest [Missionary's whereabouts]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Whereabouts of the missionary? |  

### Quest Contents
I have a request that can only be requested by voyagers who have reached the new continent, but may I leave it to you? Apparently, a certain missionary went to the New World and lost contact with them. The church is worried about that. For now, please listen to the client, a priest in Seville.
