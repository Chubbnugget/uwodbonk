# Details of the quest [Aztec fertility god]


### Details of the quest [Aztec fertility god]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Aztec fertility god |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. I was researching the Aztec god Xipe Totec and collected statues, but apparently they were taken away by thieves. If possible, I would like you to look for the same one, but it seems that you can also find a different one. If you want to know about the Aztecs, you should probably ask about it in Veracruz.
