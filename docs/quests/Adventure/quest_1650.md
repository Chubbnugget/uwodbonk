### Quest Contents
It was a request from a certain company. Apparently they are looking for an island that is relatively large, has a mild climate, has products that can be traded, and is unknown to Europe. The conditions are shockingly extravagant, but can you find it for me? Apparently there are many unexplored islands to the east of Dili. Please try interviewing me in Dili first.
