### Quest Contents
I've run into a bit of a problem. There are tigers attacking people in the mountains around here. Even if I sprinkle poison bait on it, it won't eat it, so I want to do something about it. What I want to ask is that I want to get some poison that the tigers won't find out about, and I want you to find out where to put the food. First, check out Hormuz about poison.
