### Details of the quest [Oceania competition]

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a wealthy man in this town. He wants me to find out about the unusual sports that people in the Pacific Ocean play at sea. I don't care if he's a scholar, but I wonder why a wealthy man would make a request like this again. Maybe it's something that could be a source of business. Please ask the person in question for details.
