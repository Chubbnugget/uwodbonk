### Quest Contents
Karnak-Luxor Temple, located in the middle of the Nile River, is said to be the largest temple in ancient Egypt. I was asked to investigate that temple... I hope you can find some spectacular statue, do you have any idea? It might be a good idea to consult a scholar in Alexandria.
