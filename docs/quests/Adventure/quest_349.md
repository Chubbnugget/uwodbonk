# Details of the quest [Princess tossed around by fate]


### Details of the quest [Princess tossed around by fate]

  | Attribute | Details |  
  | :--- | :--- |  
  | **Quest Name** | A princess at the mercy of fate |  

### Quest Contents
I asked you to do some research on cornflowers before. After seeing that investigation report, I received a request for additional investigation. In fact, there is an ancient Egyptian story about a tragic princess related to cornflowers. Apparently someone in the archeology field is looking into this. Search in Cairo first.
