### Quest Contents
Did you know that Alexander the Great went on an expedition to the east and went as far as India? This time, it's a request to investigate his homeland of Macedonia. I would like you to find out about the situation at that time and the prosperity of the Town. It would be great if the ruins were found. It would be best to check in Athens first.
