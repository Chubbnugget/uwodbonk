| **Discovery** | [Geography](Categories/category_2.md) / [Iceland](Quests/Adventure/quest_189.md) An island located northwest of Britain. The island was uninhabited for a long time, but Celts and Scandinavian people settled there around the 10th century. As the name ``Ice Island'' suggests, much of the land is covered with glaciers, but because it belongs to a volcanic zone, the geothermal heat is high and it is relatively warm.
