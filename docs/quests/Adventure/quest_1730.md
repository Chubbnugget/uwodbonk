### Quest Contents
I've been waiting for a request regarding jewelry, so I thought I'd ask you. It seems like they want me to research about sapphire, but it seems like it's going to be quite difficult. The client, the trading post owner, is quite knowledgeable about jewelry. People like that are going to send me requests, so please get serious.
