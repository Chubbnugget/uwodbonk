### Quest Contents
I heard that you were able to successfully investigate living things in eastern Africa. A ferocious and surprisingly fast creature that lives on the island. Considering his ability, I would like to introduce this request. I've received a request from a scholar in town to investigate a certain creature that lives in the Caribbean. First, talk to the person himself.
