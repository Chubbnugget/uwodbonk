### Quest Contents
This is a direct message from the royal family. The Caribbean region is far away, so there is still a lot of development to be done. So, they are apparently looking for someone who is an expert in ocean navigation. Please make a round trip between Santo Domingo and Seville in 80 days. Voyage records will be kept at each departure point. Deliver the report directly to Cardinal Tavera in the royal castle.
