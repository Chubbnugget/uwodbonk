# Quest [Philosopher and Evil Wife]


### Quest [Philosopher and Evil Wife] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Philosopher and Evil Wife |  

### Quest Contents
It was a request from a certain nobleman. He wants me to research about Socrates, the great philosopher of ancient Greece. It is said that his wife was a bad wife, but is that true? It looks like they're gambling money among their friends... It's an unhelpful request, but I'll ask. If you're a scholar, you probably know something.
