# Quest [Statue Staring at the Nile]


### Quest [Statue Staring at the Nile] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Statue Staring at the Nile |  

### Quest Contents
A historian was on his way back from researching ruins near the Nile River when he saw something that looked like a statue on the riverbank. This time, I would like to ask you to investigate that statue. It seems that my client, a historian, is unable to attend due to another matter, so I asked him if he would be interested in taking his place. If you're in Alexandria, you'll probably be able to get information.
