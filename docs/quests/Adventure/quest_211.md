# Quest [Durandal]


### Quest [Durandal] Details

| **Quest Name** | Durandal |  

### Quest Contents
Durandal was passed down to the Aragon family in Sicily? Sicily is now controlled by Spain. Does that mean Durandal was also passed down to the Spanish royal family? I feel like it's a bit of a shame though. When it comes to the royal family's circumstances, you'll have to ask the royal family.
