### Details of the quest [Hotori Priest's Scripture]

  | Attribute | Details |

  | **Quest Name** | Holy Book of Priest of Hortry |  

### Quest Contents
Are you familiar with Indian religion? Apparently there are four holy books in Hinduism, and I've received a request to investigate them. The one I want you to check out this time is the oldest one. Unless you are a priest, you probably won't know, so it would be a good idea to ask someone connected to the temple in Calicut.
