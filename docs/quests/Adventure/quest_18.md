### Quest Contents
It's a request from a scholar in town... I would like you to re-investigate the temple of Abu Simbel that you discovered. Actually, the request was made by a scholar to a wealthy man in town, but it seems to be a bit out of his hands. Well, I guess academics are busy too. You're always taking care of me too. Please
