### Quest Contents
Now that you know about St. George, there you go. It's a letter from that nobleman. ``Did you understand about St. George? In that case, please look for the sword he used to slay the dragon!'' If a dragon, an incarnation of Satan, is considered a saint, the best place to hear it would be in a church.
