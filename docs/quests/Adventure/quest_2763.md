I feel like it's easier if you have a language. (Check whether a language is required for the quest. You can use the language memo to proceed with the quest, but Greek is required.) Even without Italian, I was able to get the quest 60 times in Greek only. Required Adventure Fame 5000? You can request quests even if you don't have a language, but if you have both Italian and Greek, the chances of them appearing will be much higher, so I think it's better for your lieutenant to have them. |
