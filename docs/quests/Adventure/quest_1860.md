# Quest [Rare Flute]


### Quest [Rare Flute] Details

| **Quest Name** | Rare Flute |  

### Quest Contents
Do you like music? That's because I've received a request to investigate the musical instruments used in this area. I wonder if the instruments differ depending on the region. It would be easy to gather information at Copiapo's bar. For example, a sailor who is under the care of a music-loving captain.
