### Quest Contents
I have received another request regarding poisonous snakes. This time it's a poisonous snake that lives in southern China, and it seems like it can be used as a medicine just like the Japanese pit viper. The client is a crude drug dealer, so maybe he's just trying to make some money with this guy... If you're in Macau, maybe there's someone you know.
