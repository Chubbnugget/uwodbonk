| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Jacob's Stone |  

### Quest Contents
The crown stone has a complicated origin. From Ireland to Scotland and England. Isn't there a story about it being Jacob's stone in the Bible? I think you should investigate this a little more and then report it to the client. It has to do with the Bible, go to Bethel near Jaffa.
