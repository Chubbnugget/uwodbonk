# Details of the quest [Explorer exploring Red Hair Castle]


### Details of the quest [Explorer exploring Red Hair Castle]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Explorer exploring Benige Castle |  

### Quest Contents
You're the one who took over the investigation of Benge Castle, right? In fact, it seems that the same explorer who interrupted the investigation request for Red Hair Castle is now gathering information on the inside of the castle on Taiwan Island. I'm a little curious about what they're investigating based on the information provided by the guild... I'd like to know just to be sure, but could you please look into it?
