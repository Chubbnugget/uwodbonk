# Quest [Cleopatra's Son]


### Quest [Cleopatra's Son] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Cleopatra's Son |  

### Quest Contents
You probably know Cleopatra, the last queen of Egypt. Apparently she had a son with Kasael. It's a rather unhelpful request to know the son's face. I wonder which one it looked like? Just ask the scholars of Alexandria.
