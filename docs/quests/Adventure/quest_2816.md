### Quest Contents
Are you European? "Then do you know what Keikyo is?" Apparently this Keikyo became popular on the continent a long time ago. A certain European religious figure asked me to investigate this area. Can you help me? I think a scholar from Hangzhou would know more about it.

Jingkyo was widespread during the Tang Dynasty, but it seems that this monument was also rejected due to Wuzong's anti-Buddhist policy.
