# Quest [Monster Bones]


### Quest [Monster Bones] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Monster Bones |  

### Quest Contents
Apparently they were investigating dragon bones in Africa, but wouldn't it be strange if there were dragons and monsters in Europe as well? If you compare it with the ones in Africa, it might be a clue to finding one alive. If you buy me a drink at a bar in Seville, maybe someone will be nice enough to talk to me about it.

For some reason, it has changed to look like stone. There were feather-like markings around its body, suggesting that it had feathers all over its body. I have never seen or heard of such an animal.
