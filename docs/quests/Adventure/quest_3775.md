# Details of the quest [Night Sky Scales]


### Details of the quest [Night Sky Scales]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | scales in the night sky |  

### Quest Contents
I've received another request from an aspiring astrologer. It is said to be an investigation and observation of the origin of Libra, one of the zodiac constellations. So, I'm sure he's planning on having you search all of the 12 constellations. It may be difficult, but please do your best. Maybe the theologian of Nantes knows something?

It is said to be the scale held by Astraea, the goddess of justice, that measures right and wrong. [Libra] (quest_2419.md) has stars with names that seem to come from the constellation Scorpio, such as ``Northern Claw'' and ``Southern Claw,'' so it is thought that it was originally part of the constellation Scorpio.
