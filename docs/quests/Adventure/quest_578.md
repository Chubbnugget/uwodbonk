  | **Quest Name** | History of luxurious costumes |  

### Quest Contents
It seems that a certain wealthy man has acquired a luxurious costume. It looks like it's made in India from the way it's made, but I'd like to know more about its origins. Since they can't give anything away, they wrote down their characteristics and left it with a city official. If it is of noble origin, please check the details as well.
