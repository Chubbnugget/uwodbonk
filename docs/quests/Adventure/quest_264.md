# Quest [Coastline of northwestern France] Details


### Quest [Coastline of northwestern France] Details

  | Attribute | Details |  
  | :--- | :--- |  
  | **Quest Name** | northwestern france coastline |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a request to investigate the topography of northwestern France. There are narrow sea areas in that area, so we need accurate charts. The area I want you to look into is between Calais and Nantes. There are two peninsulas, so check the area. It would be a good idea to ask about the situation at Plymouth's tavern on the other side.
