### Quest Contents
Congratulations on reaching Rapa Nui. It was far, wasn't it? Was there really an ethnic group that migrated to such a place long ago? In the end, I still don't know where Hawaiki is, but if I continue to investigate Rapa Nui, I might be able to find something. So, please talk to the port official at Amboina.
