### Quest Contents
A few decades ago, there was a famous sculptor in Italy named Donatello. His works are said to be left in churches all over the place. Among the wooden statues that Donatello made is said to be of a somewhat unusual saint. I want you to look into it. If it's Genoa, there's probably someone who knows the details.
