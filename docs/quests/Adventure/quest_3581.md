### Quest Contents
This was a request from a sailor who stopped in Hawaii. Even though there isn't a large shipyard, he saw some nice sails being put up there and was curious about it. You're also particular about sails, right? If it's a good sail, I'd like to use it! Just ask the proprietor of a Hawaiian tool shop.
