### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a certain nobleman to find a dragon bone. Seriously, what do aristocrats think about when they live their lives? There's a rumor that it was found near Casablanca, so ask about it at a bar over there. If you buy me a drink, I'm sure he'll tell you something.
