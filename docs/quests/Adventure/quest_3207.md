| **Quest Name** | Sweet Scented Tree |  

### Quest Contents
I heard you know a lot about plants on the continent north of here. The owner of the trading post in this town is interested in plants from the northern continent, so he asked me to look into them. I guess it's mostly about making money... If you are willing to lend a hand, please ask the person himself for details.
