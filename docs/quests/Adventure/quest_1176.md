### Quest Contents
Hey, thank you for your help regarding the memory search. I've received a call from Santiago's daughter asking me to come over because she has one more thing to ask me. I didn't think it was a very happy ending, but it seems like the characters are satisfied with it. That was a positive thing.

Dye powder can be purchased at the tool shop in Santo Domingo *If you don't mind the trouble, you can buy bougainvillea in the desired color by visiting the San Juan tool shop after getting the Santiago information. 1. Santiago: Daughter x 3 2. Gijon: Elegant girl (bougainvillea required) 3. Gijon: Unfriendly boy 4. Gijon: Lord of the town's manor x 2 5.Amsterdam Church Pastor x 2 (Bougainvillea required, Sewing R12 required) Added on 8/30/2006 Available even without Sewing 12. Sewing is required only on the information part. Added on 11/3/2014 I think it would be better if there were 12 stitches. It didn't come out easily, but when I boosted it, it came out in no time. Added on 12/3/2016 Sewing 13, Dutch (Occupation: Archaeologist), I used over 50 pieces of referral sheets, I think it would be easier to get it if there was also Spanish (verification required) Added on 10/19/2018 I got it with no sewing, no Spanish, and 100 sheets of request sheet.
