# Quest [Knight among Knights] Details


### Quest [Knight among Knights] Details

  | Attribute | Details |  
  | :--- | :--- |  
  | **Quest Name** | knight among knights |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain nobleman. Traditionally, when it comes to knights, it's Roland from ``The Song of Roland''. He wants us to explore his life. I believe Laurent's hometown was France. If you live in northern France, there are plenty of anecdotes about him, right?
