  | **Quest Name** | bird of paradise flower |  

### Quest Contents
There are many different flowers in Africa, but there has been little academic research on them. This time's request was to research a certain flower that can only be found in South Africa. It's a unique flower that somehow reminds me of a bird, but I don't know how it grows or if it's a perennial. Check it out on Karibib.
