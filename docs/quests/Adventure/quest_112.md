### Quest Contents
This is a request from the head of the network in this town. Apparently, mermaids appear in the sea to the west from here. I don't know if it's true or not, but I'd like you to do some research on that mermaid. It looks interesting, so why not take this job?

  | **Discovery** | [Marine life](ref_16.md) / [Manatee](quest_2375.md) A large animal that lives in the sea. They do not come onto land like seals. The reason why they are slow swimmers and less alert is probably because they eat seaweed in waters where there are few enemies. She was sometimes mistaken for a mermaid when she was seen nursing her young on the sea surface, and sometimes for a monster siren.
