| **Quest Name** | groundbreaking painting technique |  

### Quest Contents
Religious paintings also have a history. Painting changed dramatically when perspective was introduced. I've received a request to investigate an altarpiece from that time. Apparently they are looking for early works by a painter named Mantegna. Could you please ask the workshop craftsmen in Naples?
