### Quest Contents
Have you ever been to Persia? Rare trade goods and expensive spices brought from India are distributed in that area. However, it seems that the lack of accurate maps makes it difficult to plan a voyage. This time, I would like you to investigate the area near the entrance to the Persian Gulf.
