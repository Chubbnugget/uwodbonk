### Details of the quest [Animal like a pincushion]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | a pincushion-like animal |  

### Quest Contents
Apparently there are animals in Africa whose entire bodies are covered in thorns. It's quite big, and if the thorns get stuck in it, they won't come out, so it's dangerous. If it were you, you would be willing to take on an investigation into this kind of animal, right? It's not like I'm going to catch you. Ask me at the tavern in Madeira.
