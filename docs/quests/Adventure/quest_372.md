  | **Quest Name** | Fishing grounds near the river mouth |  

### Quest Contents
The sea area from Sofala to Mozambique is shallow and a good fishing ground. However, the ocean currents around the estuary along the way are unstable, probably due to the mix of freshwater and seawater. It was decided that a detailed investigation was needed. Please research the terrain between Sofala and Mozambique in as much detail as possible.
