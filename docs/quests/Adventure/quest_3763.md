| **Quest Name** | fish drinking nectar |  

### Quest Contents
This was a request from an archaeologist in Naples. There was a bright star called Fomalhaut at the foot of Aquarius. There seems to be a constellation of fishes around there. However, I wonder why archaeologists are interested in constellations. First, hear from the client.

| **Discovery** | [Astronomy](Categories/category_18.md) / [Southern Pisces](Quests/Other/quest_2425.md) A constellation that appears in the southern sky in autumn in Europe. Since there are few bright stars around it, it is easy to find it by using the first-magnitude star Fomalhaut, which is the mouth of the fish, as a landmark. It is also said to be the figure of the goddess Aphrodite, who escaped by turning into a fish after being attacked by the monster Typhon, and is also said to be the parent fish of the constellation Pisces.
