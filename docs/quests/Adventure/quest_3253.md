### Quest Contents
Have you ever researched the religion of the Yoruba people? A theologian who was interested in your report has asked us to investigate a sacred grove that is connected to the Yoruba people. If you are also knowledgeable about geography, please help me out. I think Sao Tome is a good place to gather information.
