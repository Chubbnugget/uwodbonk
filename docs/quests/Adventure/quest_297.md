### Quest [Michelangelo's Painting] Details

  | Attribute | Details |  
  | :--- | :--- |  
  | **Quest Name** | michelangelo painting |  

### Quest Contents
When you think of Michelangelo, you think of his sculptures. However, it seems that he never stops painting. I heard that there is a painting like that in Italy, so please look into it. It seems that it was requested by an individual, so it might be difficult to see it. Try gathering information in Naples.

  | **Discovery** | [Artwork](ref_3.md) / [Holy Family](quest_640.md) A painting by Michelangelo. The reason why his bodies and clothing feel more three-dimensional than in other artists' works is probably because he is good at sculpture. The reason why the Virgin Mary does not seem to have much holiness seems to be due to the doctrine of the sect to which he belongs.
