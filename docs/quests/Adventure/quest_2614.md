### Quest Contents
You were the one who found Uguishi, right? I think there was a name in the research on Ying Geishi, but there is someone in Brunei who is currently showing a lot of interest in a person named Zheng Chenggong. Apparently there is something they would like you to find out about Mr. Zheng Chenggong. If you are interested, please visit the gatekeeper in Brunei.
