### Quest Contents
Apparently you investigated a small cloth bag-like frog on the eastern side of Africa. I have a request that I would like you to accept. A scientist in town has asked me to investigate a certain creature that lives in the Caribbean. It will probably be a long investigation, but first let's listen to what the scholars have to say.
