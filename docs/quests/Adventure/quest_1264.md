# Quest [Lazy World]


### Quest [Lazy World] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Lazy World |  

### Quest Contents
Many paintings contain some kind of lesson. It's a religious painting, an allegorical painting. However, it seems that a painter from the Netherlands painted a world that was filled with no lessons and was simply lazy. So, I've been receiving requests to research this painting. Ask me at a workshop in town.

He liked to paint scenes with peasants, and was nicknamed ``Peasant Brueghel.'' The monks, soldiers, and farmers depicted in this painting do nothing but enjoy delicious food and simply lie down.
