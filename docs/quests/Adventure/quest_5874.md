# Quest [Giant Nebula]


### Quest [Giant Nebula] Details

| **Quest Name** | Giant Nebula |  

### Quest Contents
Have you gotten used to discovering nebulas?　Then I'll ask for this request next time. Apparently there's a giant nebula that was discovered by a person named Lacaille, but a nobleman came to me crying that he couldn't find it. Is it because Botchan lacks skill, or is there some other reason? Maybe the information guy in this town knows something.
