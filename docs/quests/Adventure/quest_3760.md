# Quest [Heavenly Bull]


### Quest [Heavenly Bull] Details

| **Quest Name** | Heavenly Bull |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request from an aspiring astrologer. They want you to research and find the origin of Taurus, one of the zodiac constellations. You're a navigator who previously investigated Labyrinthos. If I remember correctly, a bull appeared in that story as well. I wonder if it has something to do with it. Consult with the Athenian scholars.
