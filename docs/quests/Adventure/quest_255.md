### Quest Contents
This was a request from a shoemaker in Hamburg. A young knight who came to Hamburg fell in love with the daughter of a workshop craftsman at first sight, but the girl's father insisted that she marry him only if she won the Meistersinger singing contest. In order to bring the two together, it seems they would like to borrow the help of someone who understands music. Are you the right person?
