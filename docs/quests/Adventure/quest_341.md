### Quest Contents
Do you know anything about ancient Macedonia? This is a request from a scholar who is researching the Great King, but it seems a little difficult... I only talk to people who show promise. My job is to be a scholar's right-hand man, but would you like to do it? If you can, please meet the scholars of this town.
