### Quest Contents
Oh, you. Thank you for your help regarding the ceremonial board. It seems like the client liked your report as well. I've even submitted an additional investigation request. This time, he seems to be looking for an explanation of oriental fortune telling. Next time, why not move the location to the east and investigate around Edo?
