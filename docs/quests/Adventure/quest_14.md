  | **Quest Name** | Gateway to the Adriatic Sea |  

### Quest Contents
The sea between the Italian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula is called the Adriatic Sea. You know that much, right? This time, we will investigate that area. I would like you to investigate the strait that runs from the Adriatic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. I guess the purpose is to prevent piracy. Ask the port official in Syracuse how things are going.
