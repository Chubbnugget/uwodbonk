### Quest Contents
I recently heard a strange story from a merchant who was in Bengal. There may or may not be a "moving rainbow" in the Himalayas... Well, I guess you can see rainbows even in high mountains, but the idea of ​​them moving is something that appeals to me. I'm sorry, but could you come and check it out in Calcutta?
