### Quest Contents
Remember Jakarta craftsmen? Look, this is the guy who was fascinated by 13th century Islamic architecture. He seems to be interested in Islamic ivory work this time. It seems like they want me to check if there are any good works out there. If you are willing to accept the request, please try talking to a scholar in Istanbul first.
