### Quest Contents
Apparently there's something a little troubling about the sailors in this town. We are requesting a survey on the island of Taiwan. You've done some research on that island, and I'm sure you'll be able to do it, what do you think? By the way, it seems to be a survey about living things. If you are interested, please ask the client himself for the details of the investigation.
