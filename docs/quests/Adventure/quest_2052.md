### Quest Contents
I want you to do some research on ants.Will you do it? I thought it was normal for ants to build nests underground or in trees, but it turns out there are some ants that don't. So, I would like you to do some research on that. If you're at a bar, I'm sure some customers will know about the rumors about Ali.
