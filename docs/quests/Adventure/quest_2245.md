### Quest Contents
Is it you? Who was the voyager who discovered the Galapagos Islands? I'm not surprised, but it's all the talk in the guilds around here. Hearing the rumors, the residents of Valparaiso have something to ask of you. Apparently it's a survey of creatures that eat cactus, what do you think?
