### Quest Contents
This is a request that I would like a navigator who is familiar with the southern continent to complete. I would like you to investigate the sacred place that is said to lie beyond the Red Desert. It would be a good idea to listen to the story in Kakadu first. Please make sufficient preparations before heading to the location.
