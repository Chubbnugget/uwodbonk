### Details of the quest [Octopus procurement]

  | Attribute | Details |

  | **Quest Name** | Octopus procurement |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request from the bar master in this town. The idea is to procure four barrels of octopus. I guess they are in trouble these days due to poor fishing. Octopuses should be fairly easy to catch along the coasts of Greece. Find a fishing spot and deliver it to me.
