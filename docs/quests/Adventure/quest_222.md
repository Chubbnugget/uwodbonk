### Quest Contents
This was a request from a biologist. Recently, there have been many research reports on dragons, but it seems that I would like to find something that proves the existence of dragons. In Mesopotamia, there is a myth that the earth was formed from the body of a dragon. Maybe dragons are familiar to me. Gather information in town
