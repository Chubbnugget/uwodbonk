| **Quest Name** | The tradition of Sansai |  

### Quest Contents
Do you know Sansai? I don't know much about it, but it seems like it's a type of pottery. It seems that the craftsmen in this town have something to look into regarding this. It seems like they are learning about pottery making techniques... In any case, it would be better to hear directly from the person himself.
