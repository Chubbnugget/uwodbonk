### Quest Contents
It seems like the search for the missing man has come to a dead end. My daughter looked sad too. ...However, this time the residents of Santiago all came together to request it. I want you to find a man. You wouldn't be an adventurer if you gave up here! Why don't we listen to the song again from San Juan's child first?
