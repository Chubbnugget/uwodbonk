| **Quest Name** | A warrior's proof |  

### Quest Contents
I receive a request from Yoo Seong-ryong to find someone. It seems that a certain warrior I wanted to ask for a job hasn't been seen lately. He's a talented guy, but he seems to be a little too friendly, and he seems to be worried that he's sticking his nose into things. I'll ask you to gather information at a bar in Hanyang.
