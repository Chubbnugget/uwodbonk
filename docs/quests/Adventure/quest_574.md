  | **Quest Name** | The strait that protects the transparency of the Red Sea |  

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a geographer. Apparently the water in the Red Sea is very clear, but they say that the secret may lie in the topography. Could you please do some research? You might want to ask in Aden. I think the departure station officials know more about this kind of thing.
