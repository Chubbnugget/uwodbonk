### Quest Contents
This was a request from a scholar who studies military history. There seems to be a lack of information about the Punic Wars. In particular, he wants to find out more about Hannibal's tactics. Hannibal is a Carthaginian general. Carthage is around present-day Tunis, so if you go to Tunis you'll probably find materials.
