### Quest Contents
Thank you for your hard work in researching the archipelago east of Bali. It was an interesting report. By the way, the easternmost island in the archipelago seems to be the largest, but I wonder what kind of island it is. Sorry, but could you check it out? It would be a good idea to gather information in Makassar. I asked for it!
