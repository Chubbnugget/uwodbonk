# Quest [Phantom Elephant]


### Quest [Phantom Elephant] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Phantom Elephant |  

### Quest Contents
There may have been elephants around here in the past, but no one has ever seen one these days, so I guess that's why these strange pictures are circulating. But why did the elephants disappear? If we learn more about elephants, we might find out the cause.
