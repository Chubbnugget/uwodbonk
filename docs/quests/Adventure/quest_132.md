### Quest Contents
There is a church in Amsterdam Square, southeast of London on the sea route, and apparently a stained glass window depicting the Virgin Mary is kept there. A certain scholar wants to know the style of the design. Go to church and tell the pastor what happened and ask him to show it to you. Come and report to me when you're done.
