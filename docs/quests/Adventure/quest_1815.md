### Quest Contents
I would like to request you to search for gemstones, would you accept it? In fact, an adventurer who stopped by this town the other day was carrying a rare gem. It was a pale pink and tasty product, but apparently it can only be harvested around Lima. So please come and investigate this gem in Lima.
