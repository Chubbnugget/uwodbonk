| **Quest Name** | Result of syncretization |  

### Quest Contents
Do you know the word syncret? It's about thinking that things that were originally different gods and beliefs are the same thing just by having a different name, or conflating them and believing in them. I would like to see specific examples of this "synchrony". I think the Athenian scholar knows the details.
