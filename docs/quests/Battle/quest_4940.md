| **Quest Name** | Valverde Again |  

### Quest Contents
The subjugation of Valverde last time was disappointing... However, if you had pursued him too deeply, you would not have died. It seems like he has some attachment to that place, so he doesn't seem to be moving. Please try to subdue him again! Your arms are better than his. That's definitely true
