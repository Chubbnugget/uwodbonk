| **Quest Name** | A large fleet appears |  

### Quest Contents
Something terrible happened! A fleet of pirate ships appeared southeast of Syracuse, blocking the shipping lanes in the area. It looks like a fairly large fleet. I would like to ask you to subdue this fleet, as you are very skilled. Apparently there will be a report regarding this request from the port official in Syracuse. Please use it as a reference

| **Notes** | 1. Talk to the port official in Syracuse. 2. Battle in the sea southeast of Syracuse. Subjugation target "Large fleet of Ionian Sea" Solo: Heavy caravels x 4-6, large carracks x 0-2 Since rapid fire is used, there is a high chance of flooding and confusion. It would be easier if there was someone who could use command and repair. Since they move slowly and tend to move in clumps, laying mines may be effective. |
