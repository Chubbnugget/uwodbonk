# Quest [Ruthless Tactics]


### Quest [Ruthless Tactics] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Ruthless Tactics |  

### Quest Contents
Pirates reside between Sao Tome Island and Cape Lopez to its southeast. I would like to ask you to subdue this guy. It seems that pirates attach rams to small ships and attack them. If I attacked them with a small ship, my own ship would probably be destroyed. The port official knows about them.
