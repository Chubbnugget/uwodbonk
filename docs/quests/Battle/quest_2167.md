# Details of the quest [Reduction of Merchant Ships]


### Details of the quest [Reduction of Merchant Ships]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Decrease in merchant ships |  

### Quest Contents
Can I ask you again? I want you to hurry to the trading post in town. It seems that pirates have appeared in West Africa, and there are fewer merchant ships coming from southern countries. If this continues, it will affect the market price, but I want to avoid that at all costs. Hear the details from the trading post owner and hunt down the thieves!
