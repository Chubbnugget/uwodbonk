| **Notes** | We encountered it when we entered the Strait of Hormuz. Solo was Armed Sam*2 and Jibe*2. Maybe there will be more Jibe or Sam? It wasn't particularly strong, and I was able to defeat it by scattering mines and firing at it. It seems like some emotional parts are damaged...? All of them were sunk by mines and artillery, and at 43 battles, I gained 442 experience, 99 fame, and 10,808 dollars in spoils. One each for Jibe and Sam. The spawning positions are a little far apart, like 2 ships and 4 ships. Bounty hunter limited quest |
