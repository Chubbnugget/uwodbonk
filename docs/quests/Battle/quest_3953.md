### Quest Contents
Recently, new piracy incidents have occurred. However, they seem to be strangely elusive, and the Navy seems to be having trouble catching their tails. The place where they often appear is on the ocean south of this city... If you accept this request, please talk to me again.

| **Notes** | 1. Santo Domingo Maritime Client 2. Immediately after leaving Santo Domingo and heading southwest, the ship engaged its enemy, the ``Armored Pirate Fleet,'' which was an unusually fast repair service. The moment the ship's durability or crew members drop below a certain value, repairs or surgery will restore it to above a certain value. Faster boat, higher evasion skill R, artillery and melee attacks don't hurt. You can run out of water and materials, so it's OK for endurance battles. In the case of artillery soldiers, if their skills in horizontal fire and ballistics are low, their artillery fire will hardly hit the target and it will likely lead to a long battle. Conversely, it can also be used to improve artillery skills, and in the case of penetration, adjust the number of cannon ports. Please note that the condition for completing the quest is the number sunk. Encountered near 13467,4151. It was quite difficult to get it out, and I finally got it out after using about 50 pieces. It may be easier to get a contract based on destination. |
