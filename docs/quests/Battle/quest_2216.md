# Quest [Knight's End]


### Quest [Knight's End] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Knight's End |  

### Quest Contents
I have a request for subjugation. Apparently a fallen knight is wreaking havoc around here. So I want you to attack their stronghold along the coast south of Pisa. Even though it's called a knight, it's probably just a ship that protects the base. Let that sink in first. You should ask the guild master about them.
