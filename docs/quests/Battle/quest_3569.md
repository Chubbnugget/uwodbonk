| **Quest Name** | Subjugation of exiled soldiers |  

### Quest Contents
We have received information that soldiers of the former Nasrid Dynasty are rampaging in the waters near Malaga. It has been a short time since Malaga regained its territory in the Reconquista. Maybe that's what they're after again. The Navy has requested that you come and subdue about 10 ships. If you let it sink that much, they'll be quiet.

Former Nasrid Dynasty elite troops (avoiding rowing ships) will appear two at a time, and the quest will be completed by subjugating 10 ships. Although they do not have surgical skills, they have four types of melee skills, and the enemy ships will have their morale increased and a hand-to-hand battle will begin. If you don't have confidence in hand-to-hand combat, it's better to aim to destroy it with artillery fire. Bonus Quest Monday |
