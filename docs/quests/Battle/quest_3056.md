| **Notes** | "Maritime instructor" career change quest 1: Talk to the maritime instructors at each primary school - Venice - Marseille - Lisbon - London - Amsterdam (in no particular order) 2: Report to the maritime instructor in Seville The title "Maritime course graduate" is required at the beginning of the quest. *Title change is not necessary, but it seems to be easier to appear. Genoa's quest was formerly "for graduates of the navigator school", and Sagres also has a quest with the same name for maritime graduates who entered Sagres. In that case, collect information from the maritime guild master of each base except Seville, Istanbul, and Genoa, and report to the maritime guild master of Seville at the end. You could not introduce it to a character who does not have a title. Social skills are not required when obtaining information from each city instructor. |
