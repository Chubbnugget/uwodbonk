| **Notes** | Celebes Sea, Manila Island North, Strait Blockade Fleet (around 5547 and 4145). Maritime 66 Solo challenge with 3 ships sunk and 1 captured, 944 experience, 14 Royal Fleet achievements. Enemies have high durability and flame bullets are troublesome, but artillery fire is not strong. It doesn't seem to use melee skills, but it uses roaring bullets, so be careful of crowds. It scatters mines, so if you don't want to reduce the ship's durability, don't touch it. The experience was pretty good, so it might be a good idea to try it for a change when you level up around Tainan. 10 heavy galleons, 4 solos |
