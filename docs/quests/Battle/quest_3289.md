Report to Duke of Guise Battle fame 30000, sniper skill 8 not required at the beginning of the quest ↑Can also appear with battle fame 23000 ↑You can get it even if you don't have sniper skills. ↑It might come out even if you don't have the skill, but I didn't get it even after using 200 cards. If I met the sniper skills, I got one card, so I think it's better to meet the conditions.If the age of the world you are currently in is close to the age of Chrono Quest, the presentation conditions will be relaxed. |
