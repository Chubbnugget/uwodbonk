| **Discovery** | [Medium-sized creature] (ref_14.md) / [necked peccary] (quest_3859.md) A boar-like animal that lives widely in North and South America. They are highly adaptable and live in forests, deserts, and mountains. The fur on the whole body is brown or black. It got its name because it has a band of white hair that stretches from its throat to its back, making it look like it's wearing a collar.

| **Notes** | I think the premise is Discovery, a medium-sized creature called peccary, for the sake of a herd. Please someone verify this. Before completing ``For the Flock'', it did not appear even after using 5 headache medicines, but after completing it, it appeared immediately, so I added it to the premise. |
