| **Quest Name** | Iron Deficiency |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from the boss of the shipyard in Santo Domingo to deliver iron materials. It seems to be used as a material for ships. The order is 40 boxes. That's quite a lot. If you have something to do over there, I'd like you to do it... What do you think?
