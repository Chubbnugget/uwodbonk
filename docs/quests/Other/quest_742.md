| **Notes** | -If you have already obtained the "Benedictine Nun's Robe" through other methods and registered it in the Memorial Album, you will not be able to obtain it. ↑ I tried opening it with a character registered as a memorial, but I was able to obtain the "Benedictine nun robe". I think if there are three or more free item slots before opening the map, the items will be spilled. ↑ As with other maps, I think it's just an item with a probability of appearance. |
