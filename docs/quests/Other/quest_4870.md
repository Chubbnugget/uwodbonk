### Details of Quest [San Francisco Nursery School]

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | san francisco daycare |  

### Quest Contents
I've got a request from a scholar in San Francisco. They would like to have five boxes of foreign books delivered to children whose parents are too busy to pay attention to them. Speaking of San Francisco, it's a new city, so I guess not only adults but also children are having a hard time...
