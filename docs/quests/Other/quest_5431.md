### Quest Contents
When constructing the solar ship, we would like you to investigate the place where Atlantis is believed to have once existed. Based on the theory that Atlantis existed in the Atlantic Ocean, I would like you to investigate the islands located near the center of the Atlantic Ocean. It would be a good idea to start by gathering information in Faro.
