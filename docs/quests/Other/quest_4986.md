### Quest Contents
A request came in from a sake brewery in Nagasaki. It seems that the plan is to deliver 10 barrels of shochu to Onago on a pirate island in the Caribbean. It seems like I'll have to break up all the shochu for shipping. Can you somehow prepare it and bring it to me?　The client was talking about drinking at a bar. Just ask me!
