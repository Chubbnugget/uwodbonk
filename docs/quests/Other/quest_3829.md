### Quest Contents
The other day, I was taken care of regarding a fortune-telling scammer. Do you remember the guy named Alias ​​who helped you at that time? That person sent me a request saying, ``I want to deliver a lost item to a real fortune teller.'' She seems to be in Malacca now. He seems to be around the port area, so please meet him and listen to his story.
