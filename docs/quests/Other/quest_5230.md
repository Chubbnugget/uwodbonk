### Details of the quest [A Certain Merchant's Concern]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | A certain merchant's fears |  

### Quest Contents
It's a request from a merchant named Alvero. He told me that he had something to worry about recently, so if he didn't mind, he would like to lend me his help. I don't know what's going on the other day... but, well, I don't feel like asking. If it resonates with you, then go and see me. He should be inside the bar.
