# Quest [Scar of the Storm]


### Quest [Scar of the Storm] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Scar of the Storm |  

### Quest Contents
This time, it was a request from a port official in Antwerp to deliver 20 trees within 60 days. The recent storm seems to have destroyed a lot of buildings in that area, so I guess that's why they need the lumber. Please accept it.
