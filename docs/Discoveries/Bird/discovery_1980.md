| **explanation** | A flightless bird that lives in the forests of Aotearoa. It looks similar to an ostrich, but its wings are missing. Some of them are so gigantic that they can be up to 4 meters long, making it hard to believe they are birds. It seems like there used to be a lot of them, but since people started living on the island, the number has decreased dramatically. |
