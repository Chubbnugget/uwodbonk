| **Discovery Name** | 尾流雲 |
| **Rank** | ★★☆☆☆(2) (Number of Stars on Discovery Name card) |
| **explanation** | A type of cloud that forms when rain, snow, hail, etc. evaporates while falling from a cloud. Below the clouds, thin streaks or columns of mist can be seen hanging like a tail. Observed over a wide area. |

| **Experience** | 340 (For adventure jobs. Excluding company benefits, beginner bonuses, etc.) |
| **Remarks** | The required visibility rank is between 8 and 11 because visibility rank 7 was insufficient and observation was possible at 11.

I was able to find it with R10.

 There are few cloudy days, so you tend to have to wait quite a while. |
