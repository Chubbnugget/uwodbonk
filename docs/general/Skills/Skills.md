## Job Changes and Benefits

### No Loss of Proficiency

There will be no loss of proficiency no matter how many times you change jobs.

- **Preferential → Preferential (specialized)**: No change.
- **Normal → Normal**: No change.
- **Preferential (Specialized) → Normal**: Skill level is doubled. Required skill level is doubled.
- **Normal → Preferential (Specialized)**: Skill level is 1/2. Required skill level is reduced to 1/2.

Specifically:
```
preferential R5 1000/2500 → normal R5 2000/5000 → preferential R5 1000/2500
```

In other words, no matter how many times you change jobs, the actual value of the proficiency you have already acquired will remain the same. The newly acquired proficiency is the same for both preferential and normal jobs, so it is easier to level up your skills with preferential jobs since the required proficiency is half.

However, in cases such as 2001/5000, the decimal point will be rounded down when you transfer with preferential treatment.

### Required Skill Level

When using preferential treatment, you will rank up with half the proficiency level compared to when not using preferential treatment. The proficiency level required to go up to the next rank is as follows:

- **With Preferential Treatment**: Skill R x Skill R x 100
- **Without Preferential Treatment**: Skill R x Skill R x 200

| Skill Rank | Required Skill Level (Non-preferential) | Required Skill Level (Preferential) | Preferential Treatment After Training | Accumulation Value (Non-preferential) | Accumulation Value (Preferential) | Accumulation Value After Refining |

In addition, when acquiring a large amount of proficiency, such as when producing 100 times with a low R production skill or when sailing long distances with the navigation skill, the upper limit of the surplus proficiency accumulation is 26,000. (After the proficiency limit of 26,000 is reached, the proficiency required for rank up is consumed.)
