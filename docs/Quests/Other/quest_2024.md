# Quest [True Eldorado]

### Quest [True Eldorado] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | True Eldorado |

### Quest Contents
I've received an anonymous request. It seems that a client is waiting on the northern outskirts of this city... That's right, the Lambayeke pioneer group that I asked for delivery before has disbanded. Apparently, support from his home country was cut off due to lack of results. ...Maybe Eldorado is just a dream after all...
