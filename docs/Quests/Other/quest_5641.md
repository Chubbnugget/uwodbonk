| **Notes** | Frankfurt Northeast Mansion Exploration I feel like I can't find it with zero astronomy. The R12 map will come out, but will it have an astronomical premise? ⇒No astronomy discovery, only skill acquisition.No results even after taking 5 headache medicines. I was able to get it in one go after discovering the treasure "Almagest", so maybe this is the premise? I came out without Astronomy Discovery and without acquiring any skills. Treasure "Almagest" has been discovered.　14/06/2020 |
