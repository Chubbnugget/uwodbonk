### Quest Contents
This was a request from a workshop craftsman in London. They want you to deliver 10 boxes of gold. Fortunately, gold is a trade commodity in this city, so all you have to do is buy it here and transport it to London. It won't be a difficult job for you. Ah, that's right. Don't make the mistake of selling it midway through.
