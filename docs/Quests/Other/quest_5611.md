| **Notes** | Exploring the northwest corner of the Colorado Plateau. Even after using 5 headache pills, nothing came out. There seems to be some premise. The giant guillemot was released without being found. It was released after the porcupine was found, but it may be released after the hoopoe was found. The Hoopoe was not found, but the Hoopoe was found. |
