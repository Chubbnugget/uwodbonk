| **Notes** | -The camp site is in the southeast of the map. *There may be some prerequisites. It didn't come out for a long time, but after completing a few quests and maps, it came out easily (without using headache medicine). As a candidate for the premise, we believe that it is a "mottle pattern" (or "mottled pattern") connection, which could be one of the following, but future verification is needed. ・Sakai Archives ``Map of Spotted Butterflies'' (Gifcho) ・Amsterdam Archives ``Map of Spotted Butterflies'' (Kasuritateha) ・San Francisco Archives ``Map of Spotted Whales'' (Gray Whale) ← Appeared even though undiscovered ・Calicut Adventure Quest ``Looking for the White Spider'' (Azuchi Spider) ・London Adventure Quest ``The Great Hunter of the Grassland'' (Lycaon) ← Appeared even though undiscovered |
