It is easy to find because there are three 2nd magnitude stars in a row. In the constellation map, it looks like [Orion's Belt] (quest_2437.md). The star on the far right is called Mintaka, and because it is located almost above the celestial equator, it appears to be in an orbit similar to that of the sun on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.
