Good morning. I have some delivery work to do, but could you please do it for me? The client wishes to remain anonymous, but it's not like he's transporting anything dangerous, and the reward isn't bad either. What's more, my destination was St. Petersburg, the capital of Russia. Why not take this opportunity to go? If you're interested, I'll let you know the details.
