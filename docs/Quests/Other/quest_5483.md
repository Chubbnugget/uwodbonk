### Quest Contents
I have a request from a farmer's daughter in Athens. They want you to deliver 10 barrels of chili peppers. I wonder if the spice chili pepper is necessary for agriculture. I wonder if it will be cultivated? If you're near here, you can get chili peppers in Acapulco. It may be a long way to Athens, but please take care of yourself along the way.
