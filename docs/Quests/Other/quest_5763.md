The map did not appear just after the discovery of the lion, but it appeared immediately after the discovery of the "Siberian". It will appear even if the Siberian is not discovered. The lion was not found, but the Siberian was discovered. It appeared even if the quest ``Cats don't curl up under the kotatsu'' was not completed. |
