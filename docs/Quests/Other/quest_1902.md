There have previously been reports of poisonous frogs living in the area around Portobello. However, the other day, I received information from the bar master in Portobello that there is a creature that preys on frogs. Now, it's your job. Let's investigate that creature right away.

The ability to tell whether a frog is poisonous or not based on its cry is probably due to its ears, which are larger than its head.
