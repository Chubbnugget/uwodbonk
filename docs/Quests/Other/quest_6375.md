| **Discovery** | [Weather/Phenomenon](Categories/category_19.md) / [Supercell](Quests/Other/quest_3458.md) Super-sized cumulonimbus clouds and the violent storms they cause. Heavy rain, thunder, and large amounts of hail will continue for a long period of time. The horizontally rotating air makes cumulonimbus clouds larger, and the separation of updrafts and downdrafts lengthens the duration of the storm. Occurrence time is short. It was summer.

| **Notes** | Southern Caribbean (13508,4180) Summer, daytime, cloudy An announcement was made just before night on R8 (a black smoker was found) It is extremely rare for the weather to become cloudy. Furthermore, even if the time and weather match, it does not necessarily mean that a weather phenomenon will occur; it is random. I'll be happy if I can find it within a few hours. You might want to be prepared to wait 10 hours or half a day in real time. ・The stop was on the 100th day of being surrounded by the line-of-line fleet, and lasted about 2 and a half hours in real time. Confirmed with R15. It might be better to proceed at the same time as fishing UP. Cloudy misfires appeared twice, and black smokers appeared about 10 times. Confirmed with visual recognition R13 |
