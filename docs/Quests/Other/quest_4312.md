### Details of the quest [Measures to improve movement efficiency]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Measures to improve movement efficiency |

### Quest Contents
We would like to ask for your help in order to open the canal. Since there are many islands in that area, I hear that vertical sails are effective for assisting sailing techniques. If the ship's speed increases, it will be easier to replenish supplies and subjugate pirates. For that purpose, I would like you to deliver one main top staple to the guard on the outskirts of Portobello.
