| **Discovery** | [Weather/phenomenon](docs/Categories/category_19.md) / [Tailu cloud](docs/Quests/Battle/3001-4000/quest_3517.md) A type of cloud that occurs when rain, snow, hail, etc. evaporates on the way to falling from a cloud. Below the clouds, thin streaks or columns of mist can be seen hanging like a tail. Observed over a wide area. The required visibility rank is between 8 and 11 because visibility rank 7 was insufficient and observation was possible at 11. I was able to find it with R10. There are few cloudy days, so you tend to have to wait quite a while. Rank: 2, Experience Points: 340 |
