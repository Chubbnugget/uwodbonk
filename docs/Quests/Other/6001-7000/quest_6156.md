### Quest Contents
The most well-known story in the Old Testament book of Exodus is the ``ten plagues,'' which are said to have been sent down by the Lord to lead the Israelites out of the land of Egypt. Recently, an incident reminiscent of that disaster has been reported, so I would like to ask you to investigate it.
