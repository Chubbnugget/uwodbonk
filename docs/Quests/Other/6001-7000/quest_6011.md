| **Quest Name** | Research on mysterious textiles |

### Quest Contents
This fabric is commonly used around here... You can have it if you want it. For research, why not try fighting on land or at sea, or go deep into ruins? Maybe we can figure something out depending on the special circumstances. I think it's strong against shock and water, but be careful about fire.
