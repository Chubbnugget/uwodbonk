| **Notes** | In the city of Sagres, northeast of the shipyard, on a cloudy day, I left it alone for a day and a half, and when I looked at the logs, it had occurred three times. It is thought that each time it takes about 1 minute, it cannot be seen from the shipyard. Right behind the departure point guide. |
