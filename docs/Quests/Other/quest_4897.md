### Quest Contents
A man living in San Francisco has asked me to deliver 30 pigs. Livestock in a newly emerging town? I wonder if they are planning to start on a farm as well. Well, whatever the reason, I'd appreciate your help. It's going to be a long trip, but I think you'll be fine. Just be careful about pirates.
