| **Notes** | Visible at sea 5269.5061 (Java Sea, middle of the strait with a small island east of Surabaya) Geography R13, visibility R14, both Ternate and Amboina did not appear even after using 10 headache medicines. Maybe there's some prerequisite. The map will appear even if you haven't done the land resurvey reward map. ↑Geography R8 (R12 with boost) I appeared as a sub character who didn't do much geography (main is R14) I did all of Moai Quest (Rapa Nui) with the main, so I think the premise is a series of Moai quests. |
