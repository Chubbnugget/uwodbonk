| **Quest Name** | Investigation of Faith |  

### Quest Contents
When constructing the Sun Ship, please do some research on the god that seems to have been worshiped primarily in Atlantis. Based on the theory that Atlantis existed in the Aegean Sea, I would like you to investigate the area around the Balkan Peninsula. It would be a good idea to collect information at Salonika.
