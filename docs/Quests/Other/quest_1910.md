### Quest Contents
This is an urgent request. I want you to deliver 50 bottles of the pact's delicious sake to the proprietress of the inn near the bar. And that's within 30 days! The landlady was also half-heartedly giving up, but she had high hopes since you had delivered the famous doctor's secret medicine before. Please deliver it somehow
