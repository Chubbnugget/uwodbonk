| **Quest Name** | I want to drink up the world! |  

### Quest Contents
A woman at a bar in Port Royal asked me to deliver 10 barrels of alcoholic beverages that are commonly drunk in the region. Can I ask you? Vodka is probably rare in the Caribbean, so I think vodka would be appropriate. Deliver 10 barrels of vodka to the woman at the Port Royal bar.
