| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Pastry Chef's Fame |

### Quest Contents
This is a request from the bar master in this town. They want 100 pieces of Pupuran delivered within 20 days. Poupurin was often made by confectionery artisans who lived in this town in the past, but recently there have been fewer and fewer artisans who can make it. I haven't seen a pupuran tree made by stacking those trees lately...
