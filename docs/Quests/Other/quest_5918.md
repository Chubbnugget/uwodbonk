### Quest [Research on Mysterious Arms] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Research on Mysterious Arms |  

### Quest Contents
This is a weapon commonly used around here... You can take it if you want. Research... How about fighting at sea or on land, or even going deep into ruins? Maybe we can figure something out depending on the special circumstances. I think it's strong against shock, but be careful with fire and water.
