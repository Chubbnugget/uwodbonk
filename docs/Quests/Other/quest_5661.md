| **Notes** | Southeast of South Pointy Rock There seems to be a prerequisite. Is the prerequisite "Gelta of Alshei"? Please verify. → "Gelta of Alshei" could be obtained even if it was not discovered. The premise was "insect stones that look like the soles of shoes." (Lisbon Archives, Biology, ``Strange Stone Map'') The description says ``landing just east of Casablanca,'' but the landing was on the west coast of Morocco. ↑I confirmed that the description says "Landing on the west coast of Morocco." It is unclear when this was corrected. (2020.6.16) |
