### Quest Contents
The curry bar master asked me to send him some cheese as he was out of stock. Please procure 5 boxes and deliver them to me. We don't sell cheese in this town, so we'll have to find a supplier somewhere. Calais is a town on the south coast of the Strait of Dover. It's on the other side of Plymouth.
