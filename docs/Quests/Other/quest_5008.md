| **Notes** | 1.Visible in the Eastern Mediterranean near 1146,3346 *Crete (the large island southeast of Athens, where Candia is located) seems to be the premise. Discovered the Aegean Sea? →It was discovered when the Aegean Sea was discovered. →It cannot be found only by discovering the Aegean Sea. The discovery of Samos or the Cyclades may also be a condition. → It came out with the discovery of the Aegean Sea and the Cyclades Islands. →Aegean Sea, Samos Island, Cyclades Islands was released as undiscovered. Isn't it the premise that it is in the Aegean Sea? I edited the premise as shown above (because it actually was). |
