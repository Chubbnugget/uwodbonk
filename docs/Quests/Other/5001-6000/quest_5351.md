| **Notes** | Ecological survey off the coast of the Bermuda Islands, just north of Santo Domingo (13510, 3400) No symptoms appeared even after using headache medicine 5 times in both Sakai and Hangzhou. The premise is that it does not seem to be a giant jellyfish octopus, which has similar characteristics. Experience: 440 Cards: 220 |
