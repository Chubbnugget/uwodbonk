| **Discovery** | [Weather/Phenomenon](docs/Categories/category_19.md) / [Geyser](docs/Quests/Adventure/2001-3000/quest_2904.md) A phenomenon in which steam or hot water erupts from underground at regular intervals. Although it is not known what kind of phenomenon is occurring underground, the fact that it is a high-temperature ejecta suggests that it is related to volcanic activity. Found in Whanganui West (outskirts of Whanganui). I was able to find it just outside the suburbs. You can see the phenomenon at the dead end in the east. Rank: 2, Experience Points: 270 |

| **Notes** | Whanganui West - Found at the end of the water from the northeast large rock to the south, just outside the suburbs. The phenomenon cannot be seen, but it can be seen between the rocks to the right after the message appears. It seems to last quite a long time. (You can still make it in time even if you go to the suburbs and go straight to the place where you can see the phenomenon.) |
