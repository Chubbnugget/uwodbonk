| **Notes** | 1. Istanbul Archives - Search to the right from the entrance ↑Note: There was a quest, so I used nearly 100 pieces of intermediary paper and it didn't come out, so I thought it was strange and went to the archives. I got the map from the library. This is not a quest, but a map that appears in the Seville Archives (Religious Studies). |
