| **Discovery** | [Plant](docs/Categories/category_10.md) / [Guava](docs/Quests/Adventure/2001-3000/quest_2831.md) A shrub found in tropical and subtropical regions such as Central and South America. [Guava] (quest_2831.md) fruit has been eaten by the indigenous people of Central America since BC, but when it was introduced to Southeast Asia in the 16th and 17th centuries, [guava] (quest_2831.md) leaves were used as tea leaves. There is a strong possibility that the premise is Discovery "Acai", which is a reward for re-examining the Amazon hinterland. Rank: 2, Points: 2, Difficulty: 7 |
