| **Discovery** | [Weather/Phenomenon](docs/Categories/category_19.md) / [Brocken Monster](docs/Discoveries/WeatherPhenomena/discovery_2995.md) A phenomenon in which light from the sun or other sources shines in from behind, creating a rainbow-like ring of light around the shadow. To occur, it requires widespread fog and open areas with unobstructed sunlight. Therefore, there are many examples of observations at high altitudes such as mountains. Newly added on 2017.02.07 In Visibility R9, a message appeared saying "Skill rank is insufficient to discover." Found in R11. I was able to find it with R10. I guess it's confirmed.
