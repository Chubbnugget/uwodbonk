# Quest [Mysterious Ore Research]

### Quest [Mysterious Ore Research] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Mysterious Ore Research |

### Quest Contents
This is a commonly found ore around here... You can take it if you want. If you're looking for research, why not try fighting on land or at sea, or even going deep into ruins? Maybe we can figure something out depending on the special circumstances. I think it's strong against fire and water, but be careful about shocks.
