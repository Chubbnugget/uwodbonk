| **Notes** | East coast of the North American continent (landing point) during the day? Sunny weather? rain? Near the south end of the southeast beach, visibility R9 or higher may be required? *R14 On a sunny day, after waiting for 2 hours, use the ribbon to return to the entrance and call immediately. I dashed towards the point, and as soon as I could see the coast, it was OK. You can see it near the entrance, but you can't find it unless you go to the coast. |
