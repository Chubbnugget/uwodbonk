| **Notes** | 1. East Caroline Basin Sea Area - Visible * Can be found anywhere within the sea area * Nights other than stormy weather (cloudy weather possible) * Astronomy 5+6, even 5 headache pills will not come out. Is there a possibility that there is some prerequisite? *Since it was established by Lacaille, is it assumed that the constellation Chokokuchi is present? *It was also released without the constellation Chokokuchi. * Even if I had already discovered the constellation Cyprus, I couldn't get it even after taking 10 headache medicines. *The constellation Hachibungis (astronomer's observation records/Ternate Archives) seems to be the premise. After it was discovered, it was immediately released in the Cisco Archives. *It appeared even though Hachibungis was not discovered. |
