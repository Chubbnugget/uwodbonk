| **Discovery** | [Treasure](Categories/category_4.md) / [Pisa Chart](Quests/Adventure/quest_3310.md) The earliest compass chart said to have been produced in Pisa in the 13th century. These are nautical maps that realistically depict ports and coastlines, and were actively produced up until the 14th century. Like other compass charts, it is characterized by its construction which does not take into account the fact that the earth is a sphere. Rank: 2, Points: 8, Difficulty: 8, Experience Points: 240 |

| **Notes** | Exploring the bookshelf in Galileo Galilei's residence in Pisa It seems that a map of Catalonia is the premise. It didn't come out before it was discovered, and it came out instantly after it was discovered. |
