| **Notes** | Proceeding to the northeast from the upside-down rock, it is possible that the premise is "a crocodile that lives on the southeastern continent." In the above quest Discovery, the quest "Crocodile" was already discovered, and I used 5 headache pills, but it did not appear, and after discovering the "Horse Lizard", I immediately appeared. |
