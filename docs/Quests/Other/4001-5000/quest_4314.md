### Quest Contents
There have been many reports of damage caused by pirates who have based themselves on small islands around Portobello. In order to minimize the damage, we decided to provide five boxes of cargo delivered to local pirates to the ferry that goes back and forth between Japan and Portobello. I will order you to prepare and deliver it. The delivery destination is a keeper on the outskirts of Portobello.
