| **Notes** | Cape - Pier in front of the departure station official Weather: Rain We had to enter the pier with visibility R10 * ↑ We were able to find it in the city without entering the pier. Found with visual recognition R9. Rain, night. It was a coincidence that it was raining, so I don't know where it was during the night. The rain stopped soon and it disappeared, so the time from its appearance to its disappearance is unknown. There seems to be no problem in the location near the trading post. * Occurred at the same time as it started to rain at night. It was out for about 2 minutes. |
