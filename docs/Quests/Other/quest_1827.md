# Quest [False Saint]


### Quest [False Saint] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | False Saint |  

### Quest Contents
I've got a request from Chasuki's man in Copiapo. They would like to deliver food to the outskirts of Lima as quickly as possible, but recently bandits have been rampant within the territory of the Inca Empire, so they would like to ask for an escort. First, stop by Copiapo and meet up with Chaski.
