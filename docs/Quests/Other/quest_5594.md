I don't know the details of the cause, but there are towns and fishing boats in the direction of the pillar, so the lights from those places may have some kind of influence. Visible on the east side of the Azores beach. Clear skies at night. Rank: 4, Experience points: 380. |

| **Notes** | *Visible near the side of a small boat on the sandy beach in the Azores city. The condition must be clear at night. *There must be no clouds at all. *It's not sunny at all. Be prepared to wait for an hour or two. *We were able to find it even though there were some clouds. *I happened to call at the port once and left the ship the next night after missing it. Does it depend on the season whether it's cloudy or not? by chance? *At R15. The night sky was half cloudy and it was OK in 10 minutes. Light emitting time is about 2 minutes. |
