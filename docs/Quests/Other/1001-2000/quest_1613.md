| **Discovery** | [Artwork](docs/Categories/category_3.md) / [The Prodigal Son's Banquet](docs/Quests/Other/1-1000/quest_611.md) A figure painting by Rembrandt. It is said to be a depiction of a passage from the Bible in which the son of a wealthy man spends his time with a prostitute. The unclear tone of light and shade, which is not typical of Rembrandt, may be because he sees something realistic beyond the subject matter.
