### Quest Contents
In preparation for the opening of the canal, I would like to ask you to gather information in Portobello, which is the main city. Although it has been a while since I have been involved with Japan, I am sure there are some new developments that make you wonder. I can't leave it alone. This time, we will request a survey of the attitudes of the people of Porto Bello.
