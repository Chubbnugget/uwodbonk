### Quest Contents
It is probably well known that we are aiming to expand north of the Spice Islands. I hear that there are many attractive specialty products in that area. However, on the other hand, it is also true that we are not familiar with the situation in such distant places... Therefore, you have been given an imperial order to collect information. When you are ready, call out again.
