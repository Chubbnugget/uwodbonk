| **Quest Name** | Countermeasures against piracy on supply ships |

### Quest Contents
Japan's supply ships are frequently attacked by pirates. I'd like to get rid of the disgusting pirates, but that would be cruel to the supply ship. Therefore, it was decided that the supply ships would be provided with supplies to local pirates. I will order you to prepare one box for delivery and deliver it to the abandoned building on the outskirts of Brunei where it will be collected.
