# Quest [Crystal Delivery]


### Quest [Crystal Delivery] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Crystal Delivery |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a request to deliver 50 bags of crystals, but since the shipping destination is in the East, I don't have a voyager to ask. Can you do it for me? If you can do it, I would like you to deliver the goods to the traders in Anping. It will be transported over a long distance, so please be careful.
