# Quest [Jaguar Protection Operation]


### Quest [Jaguar Protection Operation] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Jaguar Protection Operation |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a certain jaguar warrior. Apparently, they want a navigator with the title of Othellome to help protect the jaguar. It seems that dying jaguars are often found these days, perhaps because of heartless explorers. So please deliver 30 secret medicines to the daughter of Tenochtitlan.
