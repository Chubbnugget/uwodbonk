### Quest Contents
This was a request from a lumber craftsman in this town. I would like you to procure wood as soon as possible. Please purchase 5 pieces of wood within 60 days and give them to me. If they are in such a hurry, I wonder if they are also building warships... Anyway, please respect the time limit.
