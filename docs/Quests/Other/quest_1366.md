# Quest [Unforgettable Person]


### Quest [Unforgettable Person] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Unforgettable Person |  

### Quest Contents
The bar master has requested that you deliver 30 boxes of herbal vinegar. I guess they'll use it to make the herb marinade for the shrimp they serve at the bar. I get requests often. In the past, there used to be a woman at the bar who took care of everything from ordering to delivery requests, but I wonder where she went.
