### Quest Contents
It is said to be the pyramid of King Sneferu, the father of King Khufu. When viewed from the side, the angle toward the top becomes gentler from the middle. There is also a theory that a pyramid built at the same time collapsed just before completion, so the pyramid was bent from the middle as a countermeasure.
