# Quest [Panya Delivery]


### Quest [Panya Delivery] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Panya Delivery |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a doctor in Salonica to deliver 10 boxes of panya. I wonder what a doctor would use 10 bags of panya fiber for? You can only get panya from Lopburi, so be careful. It may be a long way to Salonika, but I'd appreciate your help.
