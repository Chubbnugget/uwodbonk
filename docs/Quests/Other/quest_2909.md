### Details of the quest [Learn from Paracelsus]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Learn from Paracelsus |  

### Quest Contents
Do you want to become an alchemist? It seems that Mr. Paracelsus has recently started thinking about taking on disciples. I wanted someone in the guild who seemed to have a good streak to approach me. I was wondering if you helped create the Philosopher's Stone before. If you are interested, please ask Paracelsus.

Get the fire lizard engraving from the Athens Maritime Guild's ``Salamandra Pirate Supply Ship'' or the ``Cursemaster's Toolbox'' which can be obtained with a login stamp. 3. Venice Paracelsus x 5 *Crafts (13) (non-preferential treatment also available), Adventure/Trade fame 30000 required The quest will change after the first and second job change quest. Please note that unlike the prerequisite quest, this is a "trade" quest. *By sharing the fleet, characters below level and without crafts were able to accept and clear the quest. (However, the prerequisite is that everyone has cleared the Philosopher's Stone.) *Even if you have cleared the Philosopher's Stone, if your character has around 11,000 Adventure Fame and 7,000 Trade Fame, you won't be able to receive an introduction. You'll get a message saying "You don't have the necessary port entry permission," but that's the character Venue you're heading to in Venice. If the era of the world you're currently in is close to the era of Chrono Quest, the presentation conditions will be relaxed. You may need permission to enter a port on the east coast of Central and South America.If the title is 16th century-2 and the world is in the 16th century, it appeared with adventure fame of 8481, trade fame of 50416, and crafts of 13, but another character with the same conditions appeared with adventure fame of 6841 and trade fame of over 360,000, so it may have been relaxed considerably. |
