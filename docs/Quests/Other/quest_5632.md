Appearance time is about 10 seconds. *If you use visual recognition from ``It looks like you might be able to discover a mysterious phenomenon,'' and before the discovery icon appears, it says ``The sign of a mysterious phenomenon has disappeared.'' Therefore, the appearance time is about 10 seconds as stated in the above comment (discovery was successful/season is winter). |
