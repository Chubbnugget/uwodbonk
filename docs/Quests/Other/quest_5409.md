| **Notes** | There's some kind of premise, and it doesn't seem to be a re-exploration map Dungeon Discovery? I got it after filling up the entire Discovery and memory album of the Pyramids of Giza. I was able to get out only by clearing each layer of Discovery and discovering the Khnum statue. The memorial is unfinished. Discovery of the Pyramid of Giza, including the hidden statue of Khnum, was not discovered. After that, I discovered the statues of Amun and Sekhmet in Luxor. →The statue of Amun was found, but the statue of Sekhmet was not found. |
