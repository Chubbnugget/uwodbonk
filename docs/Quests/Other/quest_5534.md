| **Notes** | Visible around the northwest waterfall in the middle reaches of the Zambezi River. Appears at the upper part of the waterfall basin on clear skies and at night. Found at the top of the cliff, at the tip of the cliff Instead of going from the northwest, we went around the tip of the cliff from the diagonal rock in the northeast.We were also able to find it from the northwest side.The direction is tilted to the left at about 45 degrees, so go northeast (towards the top of the map) from the table rock in the north and reach the cliff (added on 2016/05/10).
