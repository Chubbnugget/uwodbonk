| **Notes** | Southeast coast of South America, slightly northeast (14196.5897)? I was able to find it with visibility R12, so the Required Skills rank is tentatively set to 12. If you find it at R11 or lower, please correct the Required Skills rank. I was able to observe it with visual recognition R9. It might still go down. Conditions will probably be cloudy in the morning. At the time of discovery, the Natural Science Research Association's cultural contribution level was 30, and the visibility was R10. |
