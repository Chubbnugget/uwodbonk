| **Notes** | *It's out after completing "Unsuitable Manuscript." *I was able to find it on the map even though I had not completed "The Visionary's Mystery." (It appeared after the conversation with Paracelsus @Venice, who was running "The Visionary's Mystery.") *Is there a prerequisite? ? I read about several headache medicines, but nothing came out. *The premise is "Solving the Visionary's Mystery" (Adventure Quest, Ams Lisbon) *The "Unsuitable Manuscript" has been completed. "The Visionary's Mystery" has appeared on the map without being touched. Isn't the premise "The Unsuitable Manuscript"? |
