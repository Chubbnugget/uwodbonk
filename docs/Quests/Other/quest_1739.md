| **Discovery** | [Treasure](Categories/category_4.md) / [Warrior's Headdress](Quests/Other/quest_848.md) A headdress worn by warriors during intertribal conflicts in New Guinea. It is made by making use of the abundant decorative feathers that can only be seen on the bird of paradise's body at certain times of the year. This headdress, the chest ornament infused with the blessings of spirits, and the paint all over its body boost the morale of its companions.
