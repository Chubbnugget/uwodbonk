| **Notes** | 1. Visible in the waters off the coast of the Antilles * Can be found anywhere in the sea * Nights other than stormy weather (cloudy weather possible) * Astronomy 5+6 and even 5 headache pills will not come out. Is there a possibility that there is some prerequisite? *Probably assumed because it appeared soon after the discovery of the umbrella-like nebula in the constellation Orion. *In the case of Central and South American pioneer towns, I think it is limited to central areas.
