### Quest Contents
This was a request from a city official in Dili. He can't forget the taste of the nuts he ate in Kakadu and wants to eat them again. However, he seems to be having trouble knowing his name. I heard that you received it from the port official in Kakadu, so could you ask him directly and deliver the fruit to the town official in Dili?
