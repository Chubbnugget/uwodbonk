| **Quest Name** | The tradition of the fireball procession |

### Quest Contents
I think seeing a mysterious light is a relatively common ghost story. If it's just a story, it's fine, but what's interesting is that there are multiple accounts of actual sightings. If you are also interested, would you be willing to undertake the investigation?
