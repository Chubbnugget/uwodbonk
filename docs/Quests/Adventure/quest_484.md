| **Quest Name** | Ancient Indian Law |

### Quest Contents
What comes to mind when you hear the word law? It's about laws and regulations and things like that. However, the ``laws'' of ancient India seem to be a little different. It seems to be related to both Hinduism and Buddhism. I would like you to investigate this "law" of ancient India. Calicut will probably have some information.
