### Details of the quest [Gardener's troubles]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Horticulturists' worries |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a gardener. Apparently, she is worried about flowers that she has grown with great care being broken by hand, and she would like you to find anecdotes that will make you want to cherish flowers, as well as plants related to them. Gardening is popular in Italy, so I think it would be a good idea to consult a Neapolitan scholar.
