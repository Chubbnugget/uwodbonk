| **Quest Name** | Unobtainable Flower |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from Beatrice, who works at a bar in this town. It seems like they want you to check the flowers they received from travelers to see if they contain any poison. Apparently, the flowers he received from a customer caused him some trouble. If you want to talk about the details, I'm sure he'll tell you the details.
