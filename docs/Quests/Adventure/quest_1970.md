### Quest Contents
A city official has requested an investigation. This time, they seem to be looking for a bird with long, beautiful tail feathers. Apparently it's a rare bird that lives on the continent south of here. I'd like to ask someone who has a lot of experience as an adventurer and is familiar with the area. Wouldn't you be the right person? Please ask a city official for details.
