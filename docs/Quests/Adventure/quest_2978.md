### Quest Contents
There is a study of large eagles that are said to be treated with awe by the indigenous people of the northern part of the New World.What do you think? I'm trying to confirm a rumor I heard from a scholar who specializes in giant birds, but I'm a little hesitant about it. If you're interested, please talk to my guild master.
