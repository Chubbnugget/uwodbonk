| **Quest Name** | Habitat of pearl oysters |  

### Quest Contents
Do you know that there is a town called Samarai in the west? Apparently there's an island south of there where you can often catch pearl oysters, so I'd like you to check it out. I think you can get some information by interviewing Samarai.
