### Quest Contents
This is a request from a girl from this town. It seems like there's something they want you to go to the city on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea and find out...but what is it? She is waiting by the river, right next to the royal palace. I want you to go quickly and ask me what kind of request you have. I asked for it!
