### Quest Contents
Since you're a sailor, you've probably seen many different beaches, but have you ever seen one that's covered in shells? A certain scholar heard rumors about Sonaina Beach and asked him to investigate. It's a story about a continent far south of here, so I decided to look it up in Kakadu.
