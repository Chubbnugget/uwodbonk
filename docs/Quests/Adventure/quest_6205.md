### Quest Contents
When you think of religions that originated in India, the first things that come to mind are Hinduism and Buddhism, but it seems that they are not the only ones. Apparently, there's another religion that forbids all forms of killing and violence, and I've been asked to find out more about it. Gather information in Calicut.
