### Quest Contents
A scholar came crying... In desperation, I borrowed a book from Mr. Da Vinci, whom I admire in everything, but I couldn't read it at all. On top of that, it seems like it's been lost and they want me to find it. It seems that he had it in his hands until he showed it to the workshop craftsman in Cairo...
