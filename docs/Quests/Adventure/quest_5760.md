# Details of the quest [High Mountain Danger]


### Details of the quest [High Mountain Danger]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Alpine danger |  

### Quest Contents
I'm sure you've thought about it after doing some research, but there are too many people who recklessly challenge Chomolungma. Even if the guild warns them, they won't give up. However, if it's a warning from a navigator like you, I'm sure he'll heed it. First of all, I would like you to consult with the adventurer in Venice about what to do.
