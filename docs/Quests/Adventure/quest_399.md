# Quest [Crowned Bird]

### Quest [Crowned Bird] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Crowned Bird |

### Quest Contents
Africa is home to a variety of animals, but bird research has not progressed much. This time, I think it's relatively easy to observe. It's a crane, so I heard they're everywhere, and they're probably big. Apparently it's common in the southeastern part of Africa, so go ask them about it in Sofala.

| **Discovery** | [Birds](Categories/category_12.md) / [Crested Crane](Quests/Other/quest_1917.md) A crane with beautiful decorative feathers on its head. Apparently it can only be seen in Africa. Cranes look similar to flamingos and herons, but their appearance when standing and the way they fly are different, so they don't seem to be related.
