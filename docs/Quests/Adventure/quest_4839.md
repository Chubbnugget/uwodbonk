### Quest Contents
Do you know the Tower of Babel? Yes, it's the Tower of Babel that appears in the Old Testament. An artist from Seville asked me to do some research on it, but even though it appears in the Bible, it's just a legend, right? I wonder what they will investigate. If you're interested, why not accept it?
