### Quest Contents
It seems like you were the one who discovered the island called Marajo Island some time ago. A scholar has heard a rumor that pottery with a swirl pattern was found on that island, and has sent me a request to investigate the details. Could you please check it out? If you want to gather information, Bahia is probably better than here.
