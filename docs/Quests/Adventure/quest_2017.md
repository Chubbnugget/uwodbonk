### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. I'm sure you know about the Indian god Hanuman, but this time I'll be investigating the messenger of that god. It is said that a monkey that actually exists in India is the messenger of the god, but could you please find out what kind of monkey it is? People from the temples in Calicut will probably know more about it.

They seem to only eat plant matter. In India, they are not afraid of humans, perhaps because they are valued as messengers of the monkey-faced god Hanuman.
