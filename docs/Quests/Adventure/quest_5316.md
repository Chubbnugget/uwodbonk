### Quest Contents
A scholar in this town has asked me to investigate a mysterious fish from southern Africa. Normally, fish die when they come out of the water, but this one seems to be able to survive even when the swamp dries up. I wonder why. If you accept, please meet the scholar and listen to the details.
