# Details of the quest [Mystery of Kabbalah]


### Details of the quest [Mystery of Kabbalah]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Kabbalah mysteries |  

### Quest Contents
It seems that an old alchemy book was discovered in the archives of Alexandria. It seems that there might be something written about Azoth, but the descriptions in the alchemy book are difficult to understand, and it seems that I can't read what's written there. ...For now, why don't you go there?
