| **Quest Name** | Tone of the Earth |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a musician staying in this city. It seems like you've been to Xanadu, and you want to know about the instruments there. His theory seems to be that although different countries have different cultures, the existence of music remains the same. I'm sure Xanadu has music too.
