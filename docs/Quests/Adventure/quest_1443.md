### Details of the quest [Chasing again]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | tracking again |

### Quest Contents
It was a pain in the ass to investigate wallabies. By the way, after receiving your research report, I received information about a similar creature. I thought it must be about a wallaby, but apparently that's not the case. This time I want you to investigate that creature. Please ask the guild master for details.
