| **Quest Name** | School Rumors |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever heard the rumor that there is a training school where you can learn navigation in a village built by Portuguese royalty? A scholar in this city is looking into the reputation of that place. I don't know what they plan to do after investigating such a thing, but it seems like they don't have enough hands. Please help me if you are interested.
