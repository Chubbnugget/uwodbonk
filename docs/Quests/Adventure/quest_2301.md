| **Quest Name** | Clues to the royal tombs |

### Quest Contents
You're a navigator investigating the Copan ruins, right? I've received a request from a scholar by name. Apparently, the investigation of the ruins is having a difficult time, and no royal tombs have been found at all. Please give me some advice. The royal tombs look luxurious, so I'm sure we'll find them easily.
