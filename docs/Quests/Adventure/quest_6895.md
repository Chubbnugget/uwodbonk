| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | A big shadow running across the sea |

### Quest Contents
It is said that a fisherman from this town was floating his boat offshore when he saw a huge black shadow swimming at great speed underwater. Judging from its size, I think it's probably a whale, but could you please check it out? Have you done whale research several times in the past? Please talk to a scholar from Seville.
