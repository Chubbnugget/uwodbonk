### Quest Contents
You've come to the right place. We've received a request from a scholar in this town to investigate large fish. Anything could lead to the discovery of a new species. However, it seems that some knowledge is required, and there is no one who can take on the request... If you found a devilfish, wouldn't it be suitable for glasses?
