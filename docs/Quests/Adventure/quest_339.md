### Quest Contents
I heard you once found a dragon bone. Actually, there's been talk recently that some strange dragon bones have been discovered. It seems to have an extremely long neck. There are rumors that it may have been fabricated, so I'd like someone as knowledgeable as you to look into it. Check it out in Massawa.

| **Discovery** | [Fossil](Categories/category_5.md) / [Long-necked Dragon Bone](Quests/Adventure/quest_993.md) The bones of a huge creature whose neck was as long as its body. The total length is over 20m. However, although the shape is bone, it has changed to resemble stone. Does such a creature really exist? Although it is a dragon bone, it has no horns or wings, so it may be a creature from other legends. Abnormal Dragon Bone Rank: 3, Points: 4, Difficulty: 7, Experience Points: 506 |
