# Quest [Talisman Gift]


### Quest [Talisman Gift] Details

| **Quest Name** | Talisman Gift |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request from Shajal in Tunis. It seems like he wants to keep one Horus amulet on his person as a talisman. I wonder if there's something to worry about. Speaking of the Horus amulet...I'm sure it was discovered inside the Pyramid of Giza? I feel like there was a report like that.
