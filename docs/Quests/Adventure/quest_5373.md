### Quest Contents
Apparently there is a pyramid shaped like a staircase in the New World. However, there are rumors that there is a pyramid very similar to it in the Canary Islands. I was asked by a certain archaeologist to investigate this pyramid. Since it's the Canary Islands, it would be a good idea to gather information in Las Palmas.
