| **Quest Name** | Remnants of the capital of Baekje |

### Quest Contents
The area around the landing site south of Hanyang used to be the capital of Baekje, right? Apparently, after hearing the report, scholars decided to investigate. However, it seems that permission has not been granted by the Hanyang city officials. It seems like I would like to hear the reason behind it.

| **Notes** | 1. Hanyang town official x 2 2. West coast of the Korean peninsula, defeat one Lv52 grave robber group [3 to 5 are in no particular order] 3. West coast of the Korean peninsula: Upside down rock in the northeast 4. West coast of the Korean peninsula, diagonal rock in the center 5. West coast of the Korean peninsula, table rock in the south 6. West coast of the Korean peninsula From the large rock in the east to the hinterland (north of Gongju) 7. North of Gongju, in front of the ruins in the northeast Visual recognition *Although he is surrounded by Tipton Lv. 58 and several of his gang, he can be seen from far in front of the ruins. *The Grave Robbery Group's Lv. 52 rarely uses the "petrification" attack. * "Swordsmanship R5" is not necessary for issuing, progressing, or completing the quest. (Only for swordsmanship, the rank is insufficient, so I tried asking the quest several times with the academic designation, but it didn't come out, and when I boosted it, it came out in one shot. I think it would be easier to get it if you had it.) ps, I got it in one shot even without swordsmanship. Maybe you don't need to be particular about swordsmanship.
