### Quest Contents
You were the one who did the bird survey for me before. In recognition of your skill, I would like to ask you to investigate birds again. The person who made the request was a merchant who lives in a pioneer town on the continent north of here. Apparently they saw a huge flock of birds. I was at a bar in this town the other day, so I thought I'd listen to his story there.
