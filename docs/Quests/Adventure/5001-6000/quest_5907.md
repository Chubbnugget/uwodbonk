### Details of the quest [The reason for the graveyard]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Why we have cemeteries |

### Quest Contents
Why do we build things like graveyards? No, I understand that there are hygienic reasons. I know that there are some regions where people think that it is for life after death. However, I was wondering what it meant from a Christian perspective. Could you please ask the priest in Lisbon?
