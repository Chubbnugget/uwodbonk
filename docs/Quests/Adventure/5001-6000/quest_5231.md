### Quest Contents
Astronomer Professor Galileo knows this. I have received a request from a certain scholar to look into his works. Apparently, it has a reputation for its beautiful writing style. I'm sure the author, Professor Galileo, has it, so why don't you go to Pisa and ask him to let you look into it?
