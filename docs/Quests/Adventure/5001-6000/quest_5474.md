### Quest Contents
There's an animal called agouti that you discovered, and it seems that it plays a role in the reproduction of a certain tree. A scholar has heard the rumor and wants to find out how true it is. If you're interested, please check it out. It might be a good idea to conduct the research in Bahia, which is closer to the site.
