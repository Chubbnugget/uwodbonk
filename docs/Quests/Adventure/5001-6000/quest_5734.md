| **Quest Name** | Lord of the Lake |

### Quest Contents
If I were to become an animal, I'd like it to be a strong animal. It's no good living in fear of being chased by natural enemies. It seems that the person requesting this investigation is the owner of Lake Baikal. Sigh, I'd also like to play the role of an independent lord of a castle in a country... Oh, bad. Talk to the scholar in Lima, then head out to investigate.
