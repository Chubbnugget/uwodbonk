### Quest Contents
Apparently there is a legend about spiritual animals that bring good luck. Well, a resident of Hanyang told me that there was a constellation related to that spirit beast, so I wanted you to look for it. Well, if there was a constellation, it would probably become famous by now... For more details, please ask the person himself.
