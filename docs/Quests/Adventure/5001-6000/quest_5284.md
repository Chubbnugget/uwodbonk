### Quest Contents
When it comes to animals that symbolize courage, the lion is probably the most popular. It is also often used in coats of arms. However, among the people living in the African savanna, this unusual animal seems to have become a symbol of courage. A scholar asked me to research this animal. Please start questioning at Karibib.
