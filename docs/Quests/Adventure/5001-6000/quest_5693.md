### Quest Contents
When you think of Russia, you always think of it as being cold. However, instead of just being half-hearted about the cold, I want you to research some particularly cold places in Russia. You'll be passing through the Arctic Ocean, but you'll be fine, right? Please check the climate of Siberia.
