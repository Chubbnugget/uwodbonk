# Quest [Another Centaur]

### Quest [Another Centaur] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Another Centaur |

### Quest Contents
You found the constellation of the centaur sage Chiron earlier. In fact, it seems that there were other centaurs with personalities besides Chiron. A certain scholar has asked me to research this centaur. It seems that a scholar in Seville knows a lot about Greek mythology, so I recommend going there.

| **Discovery** | [Astronomy] (ref_18.md) / [Centaurus] (quest_2664.md) A constellation that is said to be the image of a centaur named Porus who met and welcomed Hercules when he went to capture the wild boar of Erymanthus. It is a constellation that has existed since ancient Greece, but it is difficult to see in modern Greece because the direction of the earth's axis changes due to precession.
