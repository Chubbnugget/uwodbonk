# Quest [Constellation of the Beast]

### Quest [Constellation of the Beast] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Constellation of the Beast |

### Quest Contents
You found the constellation Centauri. In fact, there seems to be a constellation near Centauri that is based on a beast. I've been asked to research what kind of myths there are and find this constellation. It would be a good idea to ask a scholar in Seville about this kind of story.
