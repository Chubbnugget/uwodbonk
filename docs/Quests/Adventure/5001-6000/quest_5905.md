### Quest [Charm of Stained Glass] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Charm of Stained Glass |

### Quest Contents
When we think of works of art, we tend to think of paintings and sculptures, but stained glass can't be beat. I've been getting requests to find some nice stained glass because I want to go see it with a lady. Could you please investigate? If you're talking about glass, I think there's someone around Venice who knows a lot about it.
