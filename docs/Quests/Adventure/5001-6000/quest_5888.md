### Quest Contents
You can tell the difference between an octopus and a squid, right? Bad, bad, even a child can understand. However, it seems that there is a creature in the sea west of here that I don't know if it's an octopus or a squid. If you want to take on the investigation, try interviewing people around Madeira.
