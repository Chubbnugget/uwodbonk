### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. The origin of constellations is generally Greek mythology. However, there seems to be a constellation that comes from the Bible. They want you to find this constellation. It's also about astronomy, so I think it would be a good idea to meet Professor Galileo of Pisa and ask him about it.
