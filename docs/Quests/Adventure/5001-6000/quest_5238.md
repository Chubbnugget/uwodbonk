| **Quest Name** | big family happiness |

### Quest Contents
I've received another request from the drug dealer's daughter in Dublin. I would like to thank you so please come to Dublin. I wonder if the client's state of mind has changed somehow?　This is a really exciting request letter. In the beginning, it was a rather prickly document.
