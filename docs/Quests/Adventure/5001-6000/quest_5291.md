### Quest Contents
This is a request from a scholar in this city. There's a rumor that there are ancient paintings painted on mysterious rocky mountains in Africa, so I'd like you to look into it. When people say it's strange, I wonder what kind of rocky mountain it is. Please ask the person directly for details.

It is lined with impressive, strangely shaped rocks created by erosion. Inside the cave, there are rocks with depictions of herds of cows and crocodiles. It is thought that this painting depicts what the area looked like in the ancient times, but the landscape is hard to believe from today's desert.
