| **Quest Name** | Desert Turtle |

### Quest Contents
This is a request for those of you who have found various turtles. There are many turtles that live on land, but the turtle we want to look for this time seems to live in an even harsher environment, namely the African desert. When you think of Africa's desert, you think of it as the Sahara. If you do some questioning around Algin, you might be able to find some clues.
