### Details of the quest [Prophesied Comet Appearance]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Appearance of a predicted comet |

### Quest Contents
You were looking at a tapestry with a comet on it earlier. I have received a request from a researcher at Oxford University to investigate comets. In fact, there seems to be a theory that the same comet appears over and over again. First, it would be a good idea to listen to the details of the client.
