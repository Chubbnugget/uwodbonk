### Quest Contents
This is a request from a town girl in this town. She had gotten into an argument with her husband over a trivial matter, and he got angry and ran away from home. I don't think it would be a good idea to get involved in other people's affairs, but he seems to be remorseful for saying too much. Can you lend me a hand?
