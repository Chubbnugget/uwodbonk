| **Quest Name** | Swirling Horned Animal |

### Quest Contents
Normally, when you think of horns with swirls, you think of sheep's horns. However, there seems to be an animal in Africa that has horns of a different shape. I'd like you to find him at a request from a certain nobleman. It would be a good idea to first listen to what a Neapolitan scholar has to say.
