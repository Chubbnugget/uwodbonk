### Quest [Poetry of Stars and Love] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Poetry of Stars and Love |

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain poet. I wanted to write a love poem about stars, so I wanted you to do some research. If there is a related constellation, please find it and report it. Love doesn't have a physical form, so I wonder if there is such a constellation. Why not ask a Lisbon scholar first?
