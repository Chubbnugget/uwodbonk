### Quest Contents
"An unexplored region deep in the mountains. A place high up in the sky that is covered in snow and seems to be impervious to the survival of any human being. But I saw it! Beyond the blizzard that obstructed my view, I saw a gigantic shadow that looked very much like a human, standing on two legs on the mountainside! Ah!"...I'm sorry, but this is the original text of the investigation request. Ask the explorer in this town for details.
