| **Quest Name** | The truth behind the royal ship sinking incident |

### Quest Contents
You know the incident where the ship carrying the royal family sank, right? The story is that the father of the child Josee took responsibility, but I received a request in a letter from someone claiming to be his disciple. I'm not convinced, so I want a thorough investigation into the cause of the sinking. If you're willing to cooperate, try gathering information at the bar.
