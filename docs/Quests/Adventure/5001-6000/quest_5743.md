Naples Church Search between the pillars on the left *Academic church skill "Priest Growth 1" required →Academic skill not required? ↑It may have become necessary to resolve the academic skill unnecessary bug. I was able to take the quiz even without Religious Studies R17. I'm a priest trying to get the second order, and I'm setting up "Priest Growth 1", and even though I have R18 in Religious Studies, R16 in Italian, and I use 300 Brokerage Tickets, I can't get it. Has anyone been able to get the order after the second time? Are you trying to receive it consecutively? |
