Yes, I have heard of Tomoza's investigation report. Now you've found the sail, keel, and stern constellations. It looks like at least one ship will be completed soon, but before that, there is one more constellation that I would like to investigate. It is said to be an essential constellation for navigation. For more details, please ask a scholar in this town.
