### Quest Contents
Have you ever heard of esotericism? It seems to be a ritual that a certain group keeps secret from the outside world. There has been a temple famous for this mystical ritual since ancient times, and even the Roman Emperor was among the participants. A certain scholar has asked me to search for this temple. A Neapolitan scholar might know something.
