| **Quest Name** | Emerald Snake |

### Quest Contents
You were researching venomous snakes in Africa before. I just received a request to investigate an emerald-colored poisonous snake that lives in Africa. It seems to be more docile compared to the previous snakes, so wouldn't it be an easy victory for you? If you accept, it would be a good idea to gather information at the Sofala rest area.
