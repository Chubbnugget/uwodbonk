| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Volcano Research Land |

### Quest Contents
I heard that a volcanologist is considering conducting research in the Mediterranean Sea.Do you know if there are any suitable places for research? It seems even more desirable to go to a place with a volcano that is still active. Since it's in the Mediterranean, you might be able to find some information if you do some research in Marseille.
