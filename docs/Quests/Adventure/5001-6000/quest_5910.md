| **Quest Name** | the last guardian beast |

### Quest Contents
It's finally time to investigate the final divine beast. If I remember correctly, the rest were the guardian divine beasts of the south. I would like them to go directly to Hangzhou this time as well and proceed with the investigation. Just like last time, there's a possibility that you'll have to go to other cities to further your investigation, so be sure to prepare well before heading there.
