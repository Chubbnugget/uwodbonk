# Quest [Acquisition of Fire]

### Quest [Acquisition of Fire] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Acquisition of Fire |

### Quest Contents
It's not cold today. On days like this, I'd like to take a rest by the fireplace, but that's not possible. It was a request from a certain nobleman. Apparently there is a story in Greek mythology about a hero who gave fire to humans. It seems like they want you to look into that. I think you should ask the scholars of Seville about this kind of thing.
