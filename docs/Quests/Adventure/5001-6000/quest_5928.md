### Quest [Childhood Friend] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Childhood Friend |

### Quest Contents
I've received another request related to a school in Sagres. This time, it seems that the client, a scholar, will be consulting directly. I had heard that they had been reporting the results of their investigations to the royal family, but this time they came to talk with a very worried look on their faces... It would be helpful if you could go see him and see if he's causing any trouble.
