| **Quest Name** | Unusual Relief |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from an archaeologist. As you may have seen, various paintings and reliefs were created in ancient Egypt. Most of the themes are from Egypt, but there are also some from other countries, so I would like people to look into them. A scholar from Alexandria might know something.
