| **Quest Name** | Favorite Wind Instrument |

### Quest Contents
I would like to ask someone who knows a lot about musical instruments. It seems that a merchant who lives in this town is worried about the wind instrument that his wife, who loves musical instruments, loves. It seems like I can't get what I'm looking for around here, so I'll have to go far. Could you please lend me a hand?
