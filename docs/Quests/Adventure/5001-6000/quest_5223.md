### Quest Contents
Apparently the drug dealer's daughter in Dublin needs something urgently. The family there is large, and even though their daughter is still quite young, they work hard to support the household. For the sake of my healthy daughter, would you please take off your skin? It seems like you don't have much time, so please complete the request within 30 days.
