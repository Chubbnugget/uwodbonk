### Quest Contents
Apparently there are some very good livestock in the south of the New World. The wool can be used for textiles, the meat can be used for food, and there are other ways to use it. If I were to sell it here... You know what happens next? In any case, do some research first. Try interviewing people around Buenos Aires.
