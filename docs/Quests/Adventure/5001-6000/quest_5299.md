### Quest Contents
A certain scholar has asked me to investigate a mysterious poisonous snake. Apparently, if you approach them carelessly, you can be harmed even if you don't get bitten. I wonder how they will attack. This seems to be an African snake. It would be a good idea to gather information around Abidjan.
