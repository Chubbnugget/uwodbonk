### Quest Contents
Apparently there are monkeys so small that they can fit in the palm of your hand in the New World. At first I thought it was a hoax, but many people said the same thing. This is a direct request from the guild, but could you please look into it properly? It was rumored at a bar in Jamaica, so please look into that area.
