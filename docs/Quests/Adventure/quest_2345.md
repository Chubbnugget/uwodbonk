### Quest Contents
Are you the one who found the poetry collection called “Manyoshu”? I've received a request to investigate the ``high mountain beyond Tagonoura'' that appears in the poetry collection. This is a request from a certain noble who read your report and became interested.Would you like to try it? I think it would be a good idea to talk to a scholar in Sakai first.
