### Quest [Unexplored City] Details

| **Quest Name** | Unexplored City |  

### Quest Contents
I have a request that only you, who have earned enough trust from the Inca emperor to receive a title, can ask. I would like to see if the Inca Empire is the golden land that the great powers were looking for. I can't tell you who the client is because it's a request that has the potential to move the country, but if you're willing to accept it, please ask the famous explorer in Lima for details.
