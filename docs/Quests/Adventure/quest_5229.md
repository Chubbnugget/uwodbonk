### Quest Contents
It was a request from a certain nobleman. Did you know that various sciences were developed in ancient Greece? It seems that there is a book that can be said to be a compilation of mathematics and astronomy among these studies, so I would like you to look into it. Since it's about ancient Greece, why not ask an Athenian scholar?
