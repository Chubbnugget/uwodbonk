### Quest Contents
I have a somewhat unusual request for you. In the city of Edo, just across the ocean to the west, people seem to be becoming more conscious of their health. Therefore, I would like you to conduct an on-site investigation. If you ask a young girl from Edo, she might be able to tell you the secret to good health.
