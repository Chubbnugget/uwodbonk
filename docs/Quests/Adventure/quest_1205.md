### Quest [Silver and River] Details

| **Quest Name** | Silver and River |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request to investigate the river. Apparently it's a river related to silver, but the details are a secret. I guess money is involved... I heard that I can find out if I interview them in Rio de Janeiro, but would you be willing to do this request?
