### Quest Contents
Have you ever ventured north of Celebes Island? It seems to be a sea area dotted with countless islands, but there are apparently two relatively large ones. This time, I would like you to investigate the northern island where Manila is located. There is also a story that Spain sent a development envoy. If you hear anything, please report it as well.
