| **Quest Name** | Jose's life |

### Quest Contents
You helped a scholar research about schools where you can learn navigation before, right? I've received an additional request from that person. As an example of someone with a strong interest in the school, I wanted to hear the story of Josee. If you go to a bar, you might be able to meet him or someone he knows.
