### Quest Contents
Speaking of the Annunciation, it is often used as a subject in religious paintings. Apparently a painter named Fra Angelico often painted this subject. It is also painted inside the monastery where he lived, but it is not open to the public. So, ask the Venetian workshop craftsman to examine the altarpiece.
