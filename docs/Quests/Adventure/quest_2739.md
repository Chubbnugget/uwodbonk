### Quest Contents
Politics exists in every region. The person who said this was my client, a folklorist. If there is politics, there will also be a code of laws or a constitution that serves as the standard. I'm sure it exists in Korea in East Asia, so I'd like you to look into it. Folk customs also appear in politics. Check it out in Hanyang.
