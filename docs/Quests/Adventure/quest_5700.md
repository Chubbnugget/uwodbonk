### Quest Contents
It seems like you've found a number of stones with patterns of living things up until now. A nobleman said he liked that kind of stone and requested an investigation. According to him, he wants something that the connoisseur will like because he has a discerning eye. Apparently the peddler in Alexandria is knowledgeable about such stones, so you should ask him about it.
