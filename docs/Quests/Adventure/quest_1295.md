### Quest Contents
It would be a major discovery if creatures that were thought to move on the ground were actually flying in the sky. It seems that there is a flying creature resembling a civet cat living in these forests. It seems like an adventurer who stopped by this town was talking about it at a rest stop. First, collect information about the creature.

Northwest of Yardein, from the huge dead tree in the north to the hinterland 8. Inner northwest of Yerdein, near Siem Reap, northwest of the red flower, near East 23, South 146, ecological survey *Go south along the road from the flower/red, continue east at the end of the road, near the base of the tree near the center *Even if you have language skills, it is difficult to get out. If there is no language, it will not come out. (Translation notes are sold in Jakarta) ← It appeared even without language skills (2022/10/17) *It's at the base of the tree just east of the ruins south of the red flower, but you can hardly see the light. It's hard to find, so I think it's faster to use observation skills (items, etc.) at the base of the trees around the ruins south of the red flower to pinpoint the location. ↑ I think you can definitely see it by displaying the map using the surveying skill.
