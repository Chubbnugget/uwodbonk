### Quest Contents
I would like you to look into the tools that have suddenly come into use recently. This was requested by a daughter who lives in this town. Please ask the person himself for the details. I wouldn't say something so unreasonable. I think I'll leave this investigation to you. Well, if you're the person you are now, you should be able to do it.
