### Quest Contents
Yo! Recently, an interesting rumor has come to me from a traveling peddler. Somehow the Vikings even made it to the Mediterranean... It seems that Viking silver coins were being circulated all over the place as proof of that. If you're interested, go to the trading post in Plymouth and talk to the shopkeeper.
