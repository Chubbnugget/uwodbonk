| **Quest Name** | Marble Statue of Pegasus and Goddess |

### Quest Contents
Apparently, the French royal family commissioned a marble statue to display in their palace. It's difficult for us to worship, but we want to investigate it somehow. It's something that will be shipped to Paris, so check around Calais first. It would be a good idea to ask at the trading post if they haven't delivered any big marbles.
