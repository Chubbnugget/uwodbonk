| **Quest Name** | Moby Dick |

### Quest Contents
I hear you know a lot about whales. Actually, there is a rumor that there is a white whale in the southern sea. I'd like you to look into the details, how about that? The sea was rough, so it was difficult to investigate. Apparently there's someone who saw it in Karibib, so please come and talk to me.
