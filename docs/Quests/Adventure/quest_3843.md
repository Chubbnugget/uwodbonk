### Details of the quest [Sacred place on the cliff]

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Sanctuary on the cliff |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request for a geographical survey of a certain place from a scholar who compiles maps of this area. The place is a cliff, and it is said to be a place that is revered as a sacred place by some indigenous people. It seems to be somewhere north of here, so it would be a good idea to gather information in Tacoma.
