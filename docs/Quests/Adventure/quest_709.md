### Quest Contents
Was it difficult to investigate hippos? Actually, I've received information that is different from your investigation. Hippos spend most of the day in water, right? However, it is said that there are some hippos that barely go into the water. This is a report from near Abidjan, so please check it out in Abidjan.
