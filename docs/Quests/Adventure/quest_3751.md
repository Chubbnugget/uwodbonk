### Quest Contents
Hey, what do you think of when you hear the word lion's tail? It's an analogy for something dangerous that would hurt me if I stepped on it. No...that's off topic. I've been asked to find a lion's tail in the night sky. First, please hear from the client, a craftsman in a Venetian workshop.
