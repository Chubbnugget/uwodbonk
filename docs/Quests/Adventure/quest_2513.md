### Quest [Unusual Fruit] Details

| **Quest Name** | Unusual Fruit |  

### Quest Contents
A certain merchant has asked me to research some recommended fruits on Taiwan Island. I selfishly say that I like things with unusual shapes and flavors... I asked store owners, residents, and scholars in Anping, but they didn't have any information. At this rate, I won't be able to meet the deadline. You should cooperate too.
