### Quest Contents
Do you know the Hittites? An ancient kingdom located on the Anatolian Peninsula. I've received a request to look into the old Hittite manuscripts. Since it was a very long time ago, it must have been a stone tablet or a clay tablet. If you consult the Athenian scholars, you might be able to find some clues.
