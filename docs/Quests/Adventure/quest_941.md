### Quest Contents
You know it's a lion. This beast is known as the King of Beasts and has been used in heraldry and appeared in stories since ancient times. It is said that they used to be found in North Africa, but they are rarely seen these days. I'm thinking there might be some south of the center, so please look into it. It would be good to go to Sierra Leone
