### Details of the quest [Supreme Beauty or Demonic Smile?]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Supreme beauty or a devilish smile? |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from an art dealer. It seems that Mr. da Vinci is quite devoted to his portraits. I'd like you to somehow show it to me and report the details. Since it's about a man who rarely draws portraits, it won't be easy. You should talk to Michelangelo first.
