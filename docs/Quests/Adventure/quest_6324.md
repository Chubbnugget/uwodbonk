### Quest Contents
It's a big deal, apparently there was a stink incident in Panama. No matter how much I questioned the people on the street, they still couldn't find the culprit. Find the culprit using your keen insight cultivated during your voyage. Since the Panamanian bar master is a party to the incident, I first ask him to interview him.
