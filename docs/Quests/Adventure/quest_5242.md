### Quest Contents
I think this is a request that only you can do. Anyway, I'm asking you to find a missing star. I wonder if there is such a thing as a star disappearing. Turning into a shooting star...oh, I have no idea. Please ask my client, a professor at an Oxford university, for details.

| **Discovery** | [Astronomy](Categories/category_18.md) / [Uranus](Quests/Adventure/quest_2678.md) It is a planet orbiting outside Saturn, and its maximum magnitude is 5.6, so it is not impossible to see it with the naked eye. It was observed as a star more than 20 times before it was recognized as a planet. The axis of rotation is greatly tilted with respect to the axis of revolution, and it is almost lying on its side.
