| **Quest Name** | The Greatest Place |

### Quest Contents
When you read a map, don't you say north when you say up? ···do not? Oh, I see... Well, maybe I don't understand, but somehow I feel like the north is better than the rest. I would like you to find out where the world's northernmost peak is, and in other words, the highest peak. A scholar in this town might have an idea.
