| **Quest Name** | Land of Iron |

### Quest Contents
Iron is a common mineral these days, but when did it start to be used and who started using it? The country that was quick to use this as a weapon would have had a huge advantage in the war. This was a request from a historian who wanted me to research the country that first used iron tools. Talk to a scholar in Istanbul.
