| **Quest Name** | Mountains of Lebanon |  

### Quest Contents
Didn't you discover the ancient Cedar of Lebanon before? Since then, I've heard that cedars of Lebanon grow naturally in the mountains near Beirut. So I would like to ask the guild directly to help you find that mountain. I guess the best way to gather information is in Beirut.

| **Discovery** | [Geography](Categories/category_2.md) / [Lebanon Mountains](Quests/Adventure/quest_475.md) A mountain near Beirut. Lebanon was named after the Aramaic word laban, which means "white", because of the snow that accumulates there. Cedar of Lebanon once grew wild in abundance, but a large amount of it was cut down for the construction of the ancient Egyptian pyramids.
