### Quest Contents
A Jamaican research team was exploring the land when they witnessed a strange phenomenon. However, since the cause was unknown, we decided to investigate from a biological perspective first. Since you know so much about the ecology of this area, I thought you could solve the mystery. Go to Jamaica and try to gather information.
