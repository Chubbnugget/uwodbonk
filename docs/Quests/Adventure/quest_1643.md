### Quest Contents
We are planning a route to reach the new continent, but we have reached a dead end. No matter how detailed the information is from here, you won't want to miss it. By the way, I'm sure you've done some research on Aotearoa before. It seems that there will be another request from Amboina town officials regarding this matter. Go to the client.
