| **Quest Name** | Preparation before pilgrimage |

### Quest Contents
Did you know that there is a small island to the west of Ireland? This time I would like you to investigate that island. I was worried that there would be no problem for my client, a monk, to make a pilgrimage, so maybe there is also a monastery on the island. If you ask the port official, they will be able to tell you the location of the island and the situation at sea. I beg you
