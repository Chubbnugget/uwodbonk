### Quest Contents
Once again, it's time for a geographical survey of Taiwan Island. As of now, we have learned quite a bit about the north and south, and there is a lot of information about the west due to its travels to and from the continent. However, there isn't much information about the eastern side of Taiwan Island, so I'm thinking of doing some research. I'll talk about the details now, but can I ask you something?
