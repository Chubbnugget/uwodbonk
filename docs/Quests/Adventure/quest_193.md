### Quest Contents
I heard you showed me Da Vinci's ``St. Anne and the Virgin and Child''?　I have a favor to ask you with that in mind. Could you please look into his painting called ``Our Lady of the Rocks''? It seems like this is a picture of a lot of trouble. Just ask Da Vinci himself in Marseille.
