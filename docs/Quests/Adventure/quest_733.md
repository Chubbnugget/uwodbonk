# Quest [Bible Prophecy]


### Quest [Bible Prophecy] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Bible Prophecy |  

### Quest Contents
I see, the story of the Spear of Longinus that is talked about in the world is not a story that is mentioned in the Bible. However, according to the Gospels, the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with the Spear of Longinus, ``so that the words of the Bible might come true,'' right? Hmm, what does that mean?
