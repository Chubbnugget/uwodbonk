# Quest [Little Red Bell]


### Quest [Little Red Bell] Details

| **Quest Name** | Little Red Bell |  

### Quest Contents
I have received a request from a European naturalist to investigate the flora of this continent. Various flowers bloom here depending on the region, but apparently there is a tree in the south that blooms with small, red, bell-like flowers. He wants us to examine the flower in detail. From here, it would be a good idea to interview the towns to the south one by one.
