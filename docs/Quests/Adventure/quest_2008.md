# Details of the quest [Observation of my beloved meerkat]


### Details of the quest [Observation of my beloved meerkat]

| **Quest Name** | Observation of my beloved meerkat |  

### Quest Contents
I received a request from a scholar who was interested in the meerkats you reported and asked me to do additional research. It seems that an observation diary would be enough. Apparently they often appear around Luanda, so it would be a good idea to start by asking questions.
