### Quest Contents
Do you know what a crocodile is? I don't know much about it either, but it seems that its entire body is covered in hard skin, and its long beak-like mouth is lined with fangs. ...I don't really understand, but I'm asking you to find out where this guy lives. Come talk to me at a rest stop in Cairo.
