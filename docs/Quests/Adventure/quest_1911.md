### Quest Contents
It was a request from a scholar who studies animals in the New World. There are rumors that a round, fluffy animal resembling a rabbit or squirrel was seen in the New World. It looks like it's fake, but it would be interesting if it really existed. Are you willing to find out? If you go to Santo Domingo, you'll probably find some clues.
