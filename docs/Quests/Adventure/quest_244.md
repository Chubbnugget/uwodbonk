# Quest [Baltic Sea Pirates]

### Quest [Baltic Sea Pirates] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Baltic Sea Pirates |

### Quest Contents
Regarding the Gaeborg incident, around Thorwyn last year, a pirate was spotted roaming the waters near Ireland. Apparently they are a group of Baltic pirates. These guys are formidable, and if you don't prepare well, they'll attack you. I have contacted the departure point in Oslo, so please check the details.
