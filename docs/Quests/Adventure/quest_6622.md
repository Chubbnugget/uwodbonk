### Quest Contents
This is a request from a rich man who is researching the Silk Road. I want you to look for evidence that East-West trade existed. I'm at a loss as to what can be considered "evidence." Well, if you found Tang Sancai, you can afford it. It would be a good idea to first interview in Hangzhou and gather information.
