| **Quest Name** | Udgatri Priest's Scripture |  

### Quest Contents
I hear you know a lot about the Rig Veda. I've received a request to research other scriptures, what do you think? It includes hymns from the Rig Veda, but apparently there are other sacred texts that are used in different ways. It would be a good idea to consult a scholar in Calicut first.
