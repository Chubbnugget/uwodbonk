| **Quest Name** | Bamboo strips lying underground |

### Quest Contents
A request came from a village on the outskirts of Mt. Yuntai. There was a long, black board sticking out of the ground on the village grounds, and it looked creepy, so I asked them to investigate. A scholar in Hangzhou was interested in this and said, ``Isn't this an old bamboo paper?'' Why don't you listen to the ideas of scholars and investigate?
