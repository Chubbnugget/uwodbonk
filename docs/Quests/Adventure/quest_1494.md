### Quest Contents
This was a request from a workshop craftsman in this town. Apparently there is an artist in Amsterdam who paints landscapes that look as if they are just the scenes he sees. Apparently it's famous among painters, but not much information is out there. I would like you to research the painter and landscape paintings in Amsterdam.
