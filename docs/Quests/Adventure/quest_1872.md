| **Quest Name** | Rational Governance Strategy |

### Quest Contents
A few hundred years ago, the Inca Empire was a small kingdom. It was through the power of Emperor Pachakuti that the empire became what it became. His governing strategy seems to have been very rational. I've received a request from a European scholar to look into that strategy. First, ask around the bar.

| **Discovery** | [Historical Relics](Categories/category_7.md) / [Clothing of Past Chiefs](Quests/Adventure/quest_1337.md) It is said to be the clothing worn by the chief of a certain tribe among the many tribes that exist on the South American continent when he assumes the position of chief. The Inca Empire ruled over a vast area, but as long as the conquered areas still had a governing function, they were allowed autonomy, so their tribal characteristics were not easily lost.
