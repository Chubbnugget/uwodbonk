| **Quest Name** | Northernmost tip of Eurasia |

### Quest Contents
I hear you've done some research in the Arctic Ocean. There's something I'd like a navigator to investigate, and I've received a request from someone called Mercator in this city. Maybe I'll go to the Arctic Ocean. If you feel like it, why don't you ask him about it?
