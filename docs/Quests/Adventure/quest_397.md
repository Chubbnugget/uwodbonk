### Quest Contents
This is a request from a monk who lives in this city. He is thinking of studying abroad in Pisa with the aim of becoming a humanities scholar. However, he doesn't seem to have the confidence to succeed. So he asked me to look into shortcuts to becoming a successful scholar. First, ask a young aspiring scholar in Pisa about it.
