### Quest Contents
Apparently, a sailor in this town has requested that you research butterflies. I think he said that the butterflies he caught on Taiwan Island might be poisonous... In any case, I was in a hurry and couldn't finish the conversation. I think it's starting to calm down, so please ask the client.
