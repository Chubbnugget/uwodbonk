### Quest Contents
Oops, I've received a request to nominate you. The client is a scholar from Hanyang, but the story is starting to get a bit disturbing, saying that he was attacked by a light while investigating Seokguram Grotto. Of course you'll accept it, right? I'm sure the scholars will be impatient, so head over there now.
