| **Quest Name** | Relics of a master craftsman |

### Quest Contents
I'd like you to check out the last works of the Amsterdam craftsman. It's a posthumous work, but it seems to have some pretty elaborate tricks set up. Enthusiasts want to know how it works. First of all, yes, the shortcut would be to ask the craftsmen at the workshop in Amsterdam.
