### Quest Contents
Mr. Shakespeare has received another difficult request... He wants me to research a certain historical novel. It seems that there is a novel in the east that depicts the era of military rule. Ever since he heard that story, he got excited... If you are going to accept a request, it would be better to hear the story directly.
