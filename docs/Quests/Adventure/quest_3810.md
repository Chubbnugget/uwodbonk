### Details of the quest [Pirate tales handed down in Europe]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Pirate tales from Europe |

### Quest Contents
There are a lot of pirates here, but I wonder how the stories are told in your home country? If there were too many terrible rumors going around, it would be a problem for the guild to come and go around here... Could you please try looking for it? It would be a good idea to ask around Seville first.
