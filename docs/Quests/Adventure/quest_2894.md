### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain monk. It is said that when the monk visited the Ming Dynasty, he saw an unusual landscape painting. The owner of the landscape painting apparently said, ``This depicts the inside of the body.'' Isn't it really strange that a landscape painting depicts the inside of the body? The people at the temple seemed to have some ideas, so I thought it would be a good idea to ask them.
