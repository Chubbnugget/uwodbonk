# Quest [Invisible Dog]


### Quest [Invisible Dog] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Invisible Dog |  

### Quest Contents
A person who has researched the mountains of Taiwan Island is gathering information about invisible dogs. I heard a dog barking nearby, but when I looked around, I couldn't find anything. It can be strange sometimes. I have no idea what it is about, so I guess it would be better if I slowly gathered information at a bar in Anping.
