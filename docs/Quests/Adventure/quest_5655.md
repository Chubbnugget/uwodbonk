### Quest Contents
Have you ever heard of a request to "find the man in blue"? This is a request I've been receiving a lot lately. A few days ago, I received a more detailed request letter. You can probably explore various places while looking for people, so why not cooperate? It seems that the client's brother is in Suez, so please do the details there.
