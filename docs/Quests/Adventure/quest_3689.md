| **Quest Name** | Russian traditional musical instruments |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a request to investigate musical instruments from a navigator who has been to St. Petersburg. It seems that the town's musician's office is interested in traditional Russian musical instruments, and would like you to investigate the actual instruments on-site and report back. Will I be able to find someone locally who knows a lot about music?
