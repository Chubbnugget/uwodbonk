### Quest Contents
It seems you've done some research on Emperor Hadrian, one of the Five Wise Emperors of Rome. That's probably why I've received a research request from a historian staying in Rome. Apparently there's something they want you to investigate regarding Emperor Hadrian. Please ask the person for details.
