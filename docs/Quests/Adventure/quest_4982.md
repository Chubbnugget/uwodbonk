### Details of the quest [Return of Theseus]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Return of Theseus |

### Quest Contents
The child who previously asked for a cow ghost has requested another request. Did Theseus return to Athens safely after defeating the bull ghost? She wants me to look into it because she's curious about the continuation of the story. I think it would be a good idea to ask the Athenian scholar who helped me last time.
