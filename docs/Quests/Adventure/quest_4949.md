### Quest Contents
This was a request from a student studying art. Apparently they are researching frescoes, but in contrast to the simple exterior, there seems to be a cathedral somewhere with gorgeous frescoes painted on the inside. Please find out where that church is. There's an art dealer in Amsterdam, so go talk to him.
