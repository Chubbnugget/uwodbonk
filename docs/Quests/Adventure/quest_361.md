### Quest Contents
It's the Vergina ruins you found... There are those who doubt whether it is really the ruins of the royal family. It would be obvious from looking at the many treasures, but there seems to be no evidence that they belong to the Macedonian royal family. I'm sorry, but could you please investigate again? Please consult with a scholar on how to prove that this is a royal tomb.
