### Quest Contents
The act of stargazing has been practiced in many parts of the world since ancient times, but it seems that the academic system for stargazing varies considerably depending on the region. Among them, there seems to be a big difference between the things around here and the things in the East. It may be a long-term request, but if you're willing to accept it, please hear from the client, a scholar in this city.
