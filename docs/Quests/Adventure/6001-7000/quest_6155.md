| **Quest Name** | Myth comes first? |

### Quest Contents
In Egyptian mythology, there is a goddess with the head of a cat, but it seems that cats also appear in Norse mythology. I have received a request to confirm whether the cat actually exists. Speaking of Norse mythology, isn't there a lot of details about the storyteller of the sagas?
