| **Quest Name** | A Certain Order |

### Quest Contents
I have a message for you from that non-commissioned officer. ``The Lord has something he would like to ask of you, so I would like you to come to Sagres when you are free.'' I didn't say, "Come right away," but if you're interested, it might be a good idea to go.

| **Notes** | 1. Sagres mansion Enrique 2. Athens library scholar x 4 3. Sagres mansion Enrique x 4 4. Search near Enrique's front *Discovery experience points: 1100 + 550 *Even if I met the required skill ranks including language skills, I finally got out after using more than 100 letters of invitation. Even if the quest does not appear, be patient and use the request form. *It didn't come out even though I used nearly 200 pieces for Squirrel, and only 10 pieces came out for Alec. Only here. *I don't know if there has been a fix, but it appears normally under Risu's academic-based request mediation and hidden requests (university SS) environment. Lisbon has a large denominator (number of quests), so I think that may be related. *Bonus Quest Friday |
