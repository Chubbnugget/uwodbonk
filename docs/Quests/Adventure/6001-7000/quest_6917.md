| **Quest Name** | Cotton Castle |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever heard of a castle made of cotton? It's said to be extremely beautiful, but there's no way a castle could be built out of cotton, right? I wonder what it all means. First of all, could you please talk to Mr. Mercator in this town and investigate?
