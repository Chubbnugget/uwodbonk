### Quest Contents
This is a request from a nobleman whose hobby is collecting antiques, but there seems to be ``suspicions'' about a statue he recently acquired. There are rumors, so I'd like you to investigate in private. ...I heard that a scholar from Marseille is my agent, so please come and talk to me.
