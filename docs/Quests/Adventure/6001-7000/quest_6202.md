### Quest Contents
The Byzantine Empire has a long history of wars with various countries and different ethnic groups due to geographical reasons. One of them is the Bulgarian Empire, which had a border with the country, and there seems to be something they would like you to investigate. My client is an Athenian scholar, so please come and talk to me directly.

It is unique in that it is carved at such a height that there are no footholds around it. Because there are old Greek inscriptions around it, there is a theory that it was built by the Bulgars, who once ruled this area.
