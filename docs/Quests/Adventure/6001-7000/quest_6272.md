| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Following the ancient river |

### Quest Contents
If the place where you found the seal and the river that only flows during the rainy season are in the basin of a river, then there are definitely ancient ruins nearby. Recently, I've received information that people have seen what appears to be ruins in that area. Maybe we can hear the story at a bar in this town?
