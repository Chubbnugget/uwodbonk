### Quest Contents
I have a request from a certain scholar. Trees of life appear in many myths, and they would like to investigate which real trees have the strongest vitality and utilize them in their myth research. The Tree of Life is said to have its origins in the Sumerian civilization, so why not try gathering information around Basra?
