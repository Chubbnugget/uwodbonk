### Quest Contents
Apparently ancient ruins have been discovered near Beirut. Academia seems to be interested in the idea that it might bring us closer to the origins of humanity. I don't have any concrete information yet, but please investigate. First, it would be a good idea to meet a scholar and listen to his story.
