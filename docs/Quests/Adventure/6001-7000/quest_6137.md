### Quest Contents
This is an advanced training task for navigators who aspire to be adventurers. Treat it as a test of your skill. The topic is an investigation into a candlestick made of silver. Apparently, a priest in Marseille wants to obtain it to display on his altar, so I'd recommend asking him for details.
