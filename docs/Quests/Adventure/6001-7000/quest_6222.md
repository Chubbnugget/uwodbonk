| **Quest Name** | the basis there |

### Quest Contents
It's the seal you found the other day, and there's talk that there might be ruins around that place. However, since there is no river like the Indus River in the desert, I am skeptical. I wish there was evidence that there are ruins... Just to be sure, try gathering information on Dib.

| **Discovery** | [Geography](docs/Categories/category_2.md) / [Ghaggar-Harkra River](docs/Quests/Battle/3001-4000/quest_3356.md) A river that is said to have flowed parallel to the Indus River in ancient times. Although it only flows during the rainy season now, there is a hymn to it in the Rig Veda as the Sarasvati River. One theory is that the Hindu goddess Sarasvati is the deification of this river.
