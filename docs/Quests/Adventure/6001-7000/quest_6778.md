### Quest Contents
Did you know about the powerful alliance that was once formed by the three Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden? It is said that they controlled the Baltic Sea and had a monopoly on furs from Russia. I would like you to investigate the current status of that alliance. The ally should have been Denmark, so gather information in Copenhagen.
