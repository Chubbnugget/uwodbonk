### Quest Contents
This is a request from the bar master in this town. I would like you to do some research on how to drink alcohol. Hmm, I didn't expect Master to ask people how to drink alcohol... You are also indebted to Master in many ways. I would like to ask you to consider this as a way of repaying me by accepting this task.
