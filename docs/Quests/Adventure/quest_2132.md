| **Quest Name** | Creating a translation |

### Quest Contents
A scholar in this city has asked me to find a navigator who is fluent in German and Celtic. I thought you'd be fine. Apparently, a large amount of ancient document translation work has come in, and it seems like it's too much for one person to handle. For more details, please ask a scholar.
