### Quest Contents
Apparently they discovered a highly venomous snake on the southeastern continent. There's a job that only you can ask me to do. Apparently there is a man who was attacked by a poisonous snake on land on the continent. If it's the snake you discovered last time, you can do additional research, and even if it's a different snake, there's no harm in investigating it. Ask the town officials in Kakadu about this.
