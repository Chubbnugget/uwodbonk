### Quest Contents
If I recall correctly, you were the one who researched the Old Believers. A request has been received to investigate an Old Believer priest who was executed shortly before Peter the Great. It seems difficult to obtain information about the Old Believers in Russia, but records from that time are likely to be found in the St. Petersburg archives.
