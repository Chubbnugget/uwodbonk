### Quest Contents
It seems that a fleet will soon be dispatched from this city to investigate the new continent. The target of the investigation is apparently west of Havana. The fleet requested an advance investigation. Why don't you try it? It would be a good idea to interview them in Santo Domingo first. Please report anything you see or hear!
