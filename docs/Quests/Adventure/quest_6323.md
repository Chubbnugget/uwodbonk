| **Quest Name** | Transparent Winged Butterfly |

### Quest Contents
I've got a request from a butterfly researcher. I heard a rumor about a butterfly with transparent wings, so I wanted you to confirm whether it was true or not. You won't catch a dragonfly just because its wings are transparent, right? Apparently a girl in Acapulco was talking about it, so why not ask her there?
