| **Quest Name** | The place of storytelling, the clues |  

### Quest Contents
I have received a request from the same client regarding the Viking voyage. He wants you to reconfirm the flow that led to the ``Land of Grapes'' in the saga and look for clues about that land. Now that the location of the "farthest end" is clear, it seems like we can finally pinpoint the path to the "land of grapes."

| **Discovery** | [Treasure](Categories/category_4.md) / [Greenlander Saga](Quests/Adventure/quest_704.md) A story depicting Erik and his friends' settlement in Greenland, and their children and Thorfinn's exploration of the west. You can see parts of it based on the saga of Erik the Red. The main difference between this and the Saga of Erik the Red is that there are a lot of exaggerations.
