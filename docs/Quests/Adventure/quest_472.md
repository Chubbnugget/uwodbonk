### Quest Contents
There is a story that a statue of Artemis, the Greek goddess of the moon and archery, was found near Athens. If you can find it, it will be quite a treasure. Just saying it's in the suburbs is just a bit of information, isn't it? Wouldn't it be a good idea to get some information from the Athenian scholars first?
