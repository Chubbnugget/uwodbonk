# Quest [Ancient Theater Investigation]

### Quest [Ancient Theater Investigation] Details

| **Quest Name** | Ancient Theater Investigation |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from an architect. Since he has been contracted to design a theater, he wants me to research ancient theaters for reference. It seems that ancient theaters were devised in various ways to make the performers' voices echo far away. First of all, it would be a good idea to visit Mr. Shakespeare in London.
