### Details of the quest [Obtain rebirth and resurrection]

| **Quest Name** | Get rebirth and resurrection |  

### Quest Contents
It seems that an alchemist in Athens wants a crystal scarab. Isn't that what a scarab is? It's a symbol of rebirth and resurrection. I hope I'm not thinking anything weird... There was a report that it was found inside the Pyramid of Giza, but I don't think it will be that easy to obtain.
