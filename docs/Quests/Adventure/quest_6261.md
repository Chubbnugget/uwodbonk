### Quest Contents
This is a request from a resident of Inhambane. I picked up an injured monkey and took care of it, but now that it's recovering, I want to find its mate and bring it home. From what I've heard, it looks like the monkey you found the other day. I would like to hear from the client and cooperate with them.
