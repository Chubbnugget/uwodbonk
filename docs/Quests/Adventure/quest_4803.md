### Details of the quest [Investigation of rock cave ruins]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Investigation of rock cave ruins |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from an architect. They want me to investigate the ruins of a town on the Colorado Plateau. It seems like everything was carved out of the cliff. I think it would be a good idea to listen to the stories of the indigenous people. Try gathering information in the Great Plains. A young man who goes hunting might know.
