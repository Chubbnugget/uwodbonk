| **Quest Name** | Hawaii's Strange God |

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a scholar in this city. Do you know about the island of Hawaii? On that island, a strange god is worshiped, and although he is usually a handsome man, he apparently transforms into a pig. He wants us to find out what kind of personality the god has. It would be a good idea to gather information locally. If you're a trader, you probably know a lot.
