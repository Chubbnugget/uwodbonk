# Quest [King Minos' Daughter]

### Quest [King Minos' Daughter] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | King Minos' Daughter |

### Quest Contents
It was Theseus who defeated the monster Minotaur. The story is that Daedalus, who created the Labyrinth, helped Theseus, and it seems that King Minos' daughter is involved in this. I've been asked to find out what's going on. Maybe a Kandia scholar might know something.
