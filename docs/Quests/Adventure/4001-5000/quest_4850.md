| **Quest Name** | An errand from Mr. Da Vinci |

### Quest Contents
Do you have any knowledge of archeology? I've received a request from Mr. Da Vinci, who lives in this town, to investigate Nineveh, but he's a very difficult person, so I can only entrust the request to someone I can trust. Won't you accept this as a way to help others?
