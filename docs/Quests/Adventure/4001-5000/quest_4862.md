### Details of the quest [The Cup of Excellence]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | the ultimate cup |

### Quest Contents
I have received a request from the owner of a trading post in this town asking me to help him choose a cup to give to a friend... It seems that ``a cup into which you can pour the starry sky'' is good. I don't understand why, so I decided to call out to you since you seem to know a lot about starry skies, but I wonder if it was a good idea...? Well, first, try talking to the client.
