| **Quest Name** | What lies between parent and child |

### Quest Contents
Apparently, a girl from Ceylon heard a rumor about the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor that you researched and became interested. They want me to find out about the constellation between those two constellations. It's a request that will likely lead to new discoveries. If you're okay with it, take the job and go listen to the story.
