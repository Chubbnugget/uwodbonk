# Quest [Giant Bird's Dream]

### Quest [Giant Bird's Dream] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Giant Bird's Dream |

### Quest Contents
A sailor from Lisbon has asked me to find a certain bird. Apparently, when I told a story about a bird that I happened to see while sailing at a bar, no one believed me and instead made fun of me. I'm just a little curious about what kind of outrageous story you talked about.
