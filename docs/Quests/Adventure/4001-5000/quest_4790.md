# Quest [Memories of Hometown]

### Quest [Memories of Hometown] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Memories of Hometown |

### Quest Contents
I have a job that I would like to ask a navigator who is skilled at navigation, and you seem to be the right person for the job. He asked me to go around by boat to find the hometown of an acquaintance of mine. If it's about an acquaintance, I'd say you should ask him/her, but I guess there's something going on. Please ask the Guam resident who made the request for details.
