### Quest Contents
Many migratory birds can be seen in the Mediterranean Sea. Apparently there are birds that hunt in groups and raise their young in groups. I've been asked to investigate that bird, so I'll leave it to you. If you're a craftsman in Parma, you're probably into rumors, so you might know something.
