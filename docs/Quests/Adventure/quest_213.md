| **Quest Name** | A Certain Lady's Ring |

### Quest Contents
It's a small search, but I'd appreciate your help. I want you to find a ring that was a keepsake of a young lady who was sent to France from Spain a long time ago. Apparently he met with misfortune and died at a young age... If you ask around a bar in Marseille, you'll know the details.
