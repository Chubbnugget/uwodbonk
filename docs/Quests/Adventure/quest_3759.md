# Quest [Stain of the Sun]

### Quest [Stain of the Sun] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Stain of the Sun |

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. It seems that a book has been published saying that there is a black stain on the sun. He wants you to find the book and confirm its authenticity. When it comes to books, the best place is probably to visit the library. Publishing is popular in Venice, so I think the book in question is also available there.

In various parts of the East, there are myths about ravens that live on the sun, but these may have been created by seeing sunspots.
