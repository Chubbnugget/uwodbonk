### Quest Contents
You were the voyager who found the rose-colored lake, weren't you? I've received another request from the player who was my client at that time. Next time, I want you to look for something called ``Peach-colored Beach.'' The client is said to be at a bar in Florence, so if you're interested, go and talk to him.
