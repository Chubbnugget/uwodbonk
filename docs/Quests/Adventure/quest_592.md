# Quest [Black Beast]

### Quest [Black Beast] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Black Beast |

### Quest Contents
There are many kinds of beasts in Africa, but did you know that there is one that is completely black? They often spend their time in trees, so some say they might be related to leopards, but I don't know for sure. You know a lot about leopards, so I'd like to ask you a favor. Check it out in Mogadishu.
