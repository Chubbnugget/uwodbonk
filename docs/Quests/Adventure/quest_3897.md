| **Quest Name** | Legend of the Hound |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a nobleman who loves hunting. The hunting dog is about to give birth to a puppy, so she wants us to think of a suitable name for the puppy. Since he's an aristocrat, I'm sure he'd be happy with a name that comes from a myth. Why don't you consult an Athenian scholar?
