| **Quest Name** | Coronation Stone |

### Quest Contents
I also received a request from a certain scholar regarding the coronation stone. I understand that England's coronation stone was brought over from Ireland, but there are many things that are unclear, such as the story of Jacob's stone. They say that there may be a true crown stone after all. ...I guess they'll go to a town in Ireland and investigate.
