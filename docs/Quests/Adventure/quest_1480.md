### Quest Contents
If you are a sailor, you must have thought about this at least once. I wonder what kind of world lies beyond this ocean, at the end of this earth. But you can't go on a dangerous voyage without profit. So how about a request like this? Survey of the island at the southern tip of this continent. Of course there will be rewards! Please do some research in Buenos Aires first.
