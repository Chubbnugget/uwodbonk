# Quest [Small Fruit]


### Quest [Small Fruit] Details

| **Quest Name** | Small Fruit |  

### Quest Contents
It was a request from the bar master in this town. Apparently, a sailor who was staying there had some fruit he had never seen before. They want you to find out what it is before purchasing it. I feel like it would be better to ask the merchant guild... First, talk to the client himself.
