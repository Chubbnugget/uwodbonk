### Quest Contents
Apparently there is a church in Northern Europe that keeps a lot of coffins. Of course, if it's a normal coffin, there is an ossuary, so that's not unusual. However, all of the coffins in this church belong to the king. It kind of reminds me of a pyramid. Gather information in Hamburg first.
