### Quest Contents
A sailor who stopped by this town apparently saw a beautifully decorated sutra box in the southern China region. The people at the temple who heard this seemed to be very interested. It seems that a monk at Mt. Yuntai showed it to me, so please ask him for details about that sutra box.
