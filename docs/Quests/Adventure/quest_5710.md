# Details of the quest [Ship in the Starry Sky]


### Details of the quest [Ship in the Starry Sky]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | starry ship |  

### Quest Contents
The sail, the keel, the stern, and the compass... Once you have all this, it's time to start rowing out into the ocean. But before that, I want you to find out why the parts of the ship were separated into constellations. I wonder if the model, the Argo ship, fell apart in Greek mythology? If you're in Athens, there's probably someone you know.
