# Quest [White Coat]

### Quest [White Coat] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | White Coat |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a scholar in this city. I've started researching a creature that looks like a white coat in Scandinavia, but I hear they're having a hard time gathering information. So, it seems they would like to borrow the help of a skilled navigator. Would you like to hear the details from the person himself/herself?
