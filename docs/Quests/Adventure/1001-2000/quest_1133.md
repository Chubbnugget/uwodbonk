### Quest Contents
This time I have a somewhat big request. Please keep your spirits up. This was a direct request from Queen Maria in Antwerp. Details have not been heard as it seems to be related to the personal stories of the royal family. Doesn't it make sense that he nominated you? Well, I asked for it.
