# Details of the quest [Fish with feathers]

### Details of the quest [Fish with feathers]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | A family of fish with feathers |

### Quest Contents
You were the one investigating the fish with feathers on its back, weren't you? The naturalist asked me to find a member of that fish's family. I really liked that fish. If they are fellow fish, they probably live in the same Nile River... It would be best to listen to the story in town before investigating.
