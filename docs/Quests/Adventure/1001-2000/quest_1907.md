### Quest Contents
I received a request from a scholar who studies the history of the Islamic world to research a man named Baibars, who was a sultan of the Mamluk dynasty. He seems to be quite a great figure in the Islamic world, so if you talk to scholars around Alexandria, you might be able to learn a lot about him.
