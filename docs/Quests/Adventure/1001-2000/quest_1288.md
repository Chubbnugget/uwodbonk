### Quest Contents
This is a request from a wealthy man. He wants you to investigate a divine statue in the ruins on the outskirts of Yardein. However, there is a condition that you refrain from taking it home or even touching it, as the benefits will be diminished. It seems that if there is a wonderful statue of a god, the client will go and see it himself... That's a totally luxurious story...
