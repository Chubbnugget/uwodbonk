| **Quest Name** | 驚天動地 |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a scholar in this city. The applicant must be knowledgeable about birds east of India and have researched giant otters. I don't know what the relationship between the two is, but he said that it would be a discovery that would overturn common sense. I think this will be a meaningful investigation for you as well.
