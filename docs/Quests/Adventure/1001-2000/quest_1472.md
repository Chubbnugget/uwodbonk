# Quest [Isolated Imperial City]

### Quest [Isolated Imperial City] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Isolated Imperial City |

### Quest Contents
You've probably heard of it. About Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. There was news that a Spanish man named Cortes had entered the area, but since then all contact has been lost. I would like to restore the contact network and ask them to investigate the area. You should go to Merida first.

Battle with the "Cortez Patrol Boat" on the ocean north-northeast from Veracruz in the Gulf of Mexico (10 heavy galleons) *After the battle is won, the quest will move to "Another World". Although I appeared without social skills, I was forced to continue to the next quest [Another World]. In that case, it seems that social skills (R3?) are required.
