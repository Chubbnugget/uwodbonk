# Quest [Large Flower]

### Quest [Large Flower] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Large Flower |

### Quest Contents
I have received a request from a scholar to find a large flower. Apparently, the ideal flower would be larger than any reported flower. The research area will probably be in a hot, rainy region where plants grow well. It might be difficult if you don't have experience in long-distance sailing. For more details, please ask a scholar in town.
