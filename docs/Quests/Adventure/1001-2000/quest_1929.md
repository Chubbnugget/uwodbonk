### Quest Contents
Have you ever seen a dromedary? A travel scholar from Merida would like to ask you to research an animal that resembles a camel. I was told that it would be a long-distance investigation, so I'd be happy with the reward. If you're willing to take on the job, please visit the traveling scholar in Merida.
