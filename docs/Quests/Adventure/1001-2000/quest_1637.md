### Quest Contents
I heard that India has a sea worthy of being called a paradise. There are schools of colorful fish, and the color of the sea is said to be like sapphire. The request is to find out where the ocean is. Please go to Calcutta and ask questions. It's going to be a bit of a long trip, but I asked you to do it.
