### Quest Contents
This was a request from a bride who had just married into a wealthy Indian family. Apparently, when she wore a black sari at home, her mother gave her a lecture. It seems like she's asking me to dress more like a new wife, so she wants me to find some clothes that would be suitable for a new wife. How about you, can you look for it?
