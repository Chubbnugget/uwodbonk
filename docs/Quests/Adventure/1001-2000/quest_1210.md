# Quest [Road to the West Coast of the New World]

### Quest [Road to the West Coast of the New World] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Road to the West Coast of the New World |

### Quest Contents
I have a request to search for a potential site for a port, but would you be able to help? There is a plan to connect the east and west sides of the New World by land and trade, but in order to do so, ports are needed on both sides. I would like you to search for a potential port location on this side. Maybe the bar master knows a good place.
