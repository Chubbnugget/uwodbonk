| **Quest Name** | bird that lives on the ground |

### Quest Contents
I have received a request from a scholar who is researching this area. I thought that birds flew in the sky, but apparently there are birds that live underground on this continent. The investigation has not yielded any significant results and is currently suspended. I haven't investigated beyond Merida, so could you take over from there?
