### Quest Contents
I heard you found an old Buddhist temple in Java. Then, a certain scholar came to me and said that he wanted to investigate a Buddhist statue in the shape of Hosho Nyorai. Can I leave it to you? It has been a long time since Islam has penetrated Java, but it seems that Buddhism still remains in the east. Ask me in Surabaya.
