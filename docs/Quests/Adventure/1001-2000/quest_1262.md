### Quest Contents
I've received a request from Michelangelo. It seems that the right arm of the Laocoon statue that was found the other day has safely arrived in Venice. However, Michelangelo did not undertake the restoration work. I want you to do it. I have no idea how the wind is blowing, but please try talking to him.
