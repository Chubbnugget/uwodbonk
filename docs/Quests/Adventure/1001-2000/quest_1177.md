| **Quest Name** | Good port production area |

### Quest Contents
Bergen is known as a good natural port, and that area is particularly rich in good ports. Why are there so many good ports in that area? My current request is to investigate that. A shipwright from Bergen might know why. Go listen to it right away

| **Discovery** | [Geography](docs/Categories/category_2.md) / [Fjord](docs/Quests/Adventure/1-1000/quest_393.md) A complex coastline found in cold regions. This seems to be caused by some kind of strong erosion. If it were water, the erosion would be more gradual, so I wonder if it's caused by ice.
