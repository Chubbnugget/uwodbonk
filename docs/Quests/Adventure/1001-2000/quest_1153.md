# Quest [Aztec Cultural God]

| **Quest Name** | Aztec Cultural God |

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. I was researching the Aztec cultural god Quetzalcoatl and collected statues, but apparently they were taken away by thieves. If possible, I would like you to look for the same one, but it seems that you can also find a different one. If you want to know about the Aztecs, you should probably ask about it in Veracruz.
