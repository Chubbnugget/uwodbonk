| **Quest Name** | flowers dedicated to a friend |

### Quest Contents
A European naturalist wants me to report any rare flowers you find on this continent. When I asked the scholar, he told me that he wanted to name a new type of flower after his best friend as a symbol of their undying friendship. Apparently they have investigated the eastern part of the continent, so we need to go further. I don't think he went all the way to Lima.
