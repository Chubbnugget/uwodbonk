### Quest [Mysterious Eyes] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Mysterious Eyes |

### Quest Contents
It seems that the research team in this city succeeded in capturing the large-eyed creature that you investigated earlier. A peddler in town heard about it and asked if he could get his hands on it, but is there anything that can be done? It looks like the survey team is currently docking at Achin, so please go and negotiate right away.
