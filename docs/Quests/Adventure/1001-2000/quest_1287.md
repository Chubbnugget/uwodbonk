I have a request that I would like you to complete. There seems to be a huge temple deep in the outskirts of Yardein, and it is said that there are many statues of gods left behind. In particular, the statues of goddesses are numerous and highly rated. This time, check out the statue of this goddess. I'm looking forward to a detailed report.
