### Details of the quest [Hidden history in heraldic characters]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | The history hidden in the coat of arms characters |

### Quest Contents
I've received an investigation request from a secret client again. Apparently, they want us to find out more about the genealogy of the Palenque royal family. You said that the buildings in the ruins were carved with letters, and that if you could decipher them, you would be able to understand a lot of things. Why don't you start by asking about letters on the street?
