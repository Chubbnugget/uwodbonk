### Quest Contents
People who are passionate about gardening are willing to spend money on rare flowers. This is also a similar request, what do you think? It's going to be quite a long trip. I was told that in the remote parts of South Africa, there would be flowers that no one knew about. Ask me at the bar in Karibib.
