### Quest Contents
I'm sorry this happens so often, but this is a request regarding a trans-Pacific route. I read the report on the Fiji Islands, and they seem like a great place for a supply base. Therefore, I would like you to conduct a detailed investigation of the waters near the islands. It would be difficult to obtain information in advance. As soon as you're ready, come right over.
