| **Quest Name** | It's the Emperor's Mountain |

### Quest Contents
This was a direct request from the Spanish royal family. The royal family set out for the Golden Land in search of a large amount of gold and silver, and reached the Inca Empire, but it seems they are having a hard time finding a good vein of ore. So, the idea is to have a skilled navigator discover the ore vein. For now, please gather information at a bar in Lima.
