| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Sacrificial Statue |

### Quest Contents
There are many buildings in the ruins of Chichen Itza, but their purpose is still unknown. That place is covered in jungle, so we can't send a large-scale investigation team. There seems to be a particular lack of information about pyramid-shaped buildings. You, collect information at the bar and head to the location.
