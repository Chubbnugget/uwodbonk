The formation process of the islands is similar to that of deltas, and appears to have been formed by the accumulation of sediment carried by the Mekong River. As a result, many of the islands at the river mouth are low-lying areas and are submerged during the rainy season. Estuary Archipelago Rank: 4, Points: 7, Difficulty: 9, Experience Points: 744 |
