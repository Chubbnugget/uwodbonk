### Quest Contents
I heard you found the Angkor ruins. Well then, let's leave this request to you. Did you notice the relief of a dancing woman on the Angkor building? That woman is a celestial maiden...in the local language, she is called an ``Apsara.'' I want you to find out more about that Apsara. Please ask me on the street first.
