# Quest [Distant Promise]

### Quest [Distant Promise] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Distant Promise |

### Quest Contents
I would like you to find out what happened to the bullfighter Lescatore after he retired. Don't you think it's strange that a person with such talent would retire at the moment that could be called the pinnacle of his life? Actually, there's someone in town who saw him. I want you to investigate carefully.
