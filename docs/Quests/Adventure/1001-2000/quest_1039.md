| **Quest Name** | Western Advancement of Nomads |

### Quest Contents
Long ago, nomadic tribes from the far east moved westward. You know that too, right? This is a request to find out about the characteristics and tactics of that army. I'm sure their territory extended to the north of Istanbul, so maybe you could find out something by going to Istanbul?
