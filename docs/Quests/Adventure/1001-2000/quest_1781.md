### Quest Contents
It seems that a book summarizing the life of an outstanding artist was recently published. I haven't been to this town yet, but as someone who does this kind of work, I can't help but be curious about it. I'm sorry, but could you please look into this book? According to the story, it's already circulating around Genoa.
