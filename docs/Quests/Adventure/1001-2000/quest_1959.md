### Quest Contents
You did a great job finding the picture of the birdman. However, as I was reading your report, I became more interested in Makemake God... This is a direct request from the guild. I request further investigation into this Makemake god. Then, look for items related to this god. Please visit the sailor in Lun again.

The person who holds the title of Birdman (Tangata Manu), who is the incarnation of Makemake, has full authority over the island, so it can be said that he is the central figure among the gods worshiped on Rapa Nui.
