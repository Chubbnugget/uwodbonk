| **Quest Name** | Proud Aztec Hero |

### Quest Contents
Apparently the Aztecs were very good at military. Cortés was also surprised by the unexpected high level of military technology, and even reported it in a letter to the King of Spain. I would like to find out what kind of system it actually has. It would be a good idea to start your investigation at Portobello's bar.

It is said that only the elite members of the aristocratic class could become jaguar warriors. I wonder if this mask is meant to honor the warriors who died an honorable death.
