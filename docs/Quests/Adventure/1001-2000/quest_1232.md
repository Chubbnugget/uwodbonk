| **Quest Name** | Endless Wilderness |

### Quest Contents
If you're a navigator like yourself, I think it's okay to entrust this request to you. The story is that in the southern part of the New World, there is a vast land that few people have yet set foot on. What do you think about the investigation? Should I give it a try? You should ask around in San Antonio about the place.
