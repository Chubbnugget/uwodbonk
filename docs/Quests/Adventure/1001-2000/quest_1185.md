### Quest Contents
There are many voyages that can be called great achievements, but Magellan's circumnavigation of the world is one that stands out. This request came from a scholar who is compiling Magellan's circumnavigation of the world. He seems to want to know the difficult part of the voyage that caused Magellan the most trouble. You should ask the scholars in this town first.
