| **Quest Name** | The magic spear in my hands |

### Quest Contents
Come to think of it, you've also done a lot of research on Cu Chulainn. You even find the stone that was set in Gaeborg's hilt, which is a great job. ...Actually, I heard that there really was a Gaeborg in a church in London. If you've come this far, you'll have no choice but to get Gaeborg!
