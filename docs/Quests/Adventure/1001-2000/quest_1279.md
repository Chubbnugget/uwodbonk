| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Stone Collection |

### Quest Contents
Have you been to Yardane town? It seems that strange stones are often found on the outskirts of that city. You don't really care about stones, do you? Apparently that's what scholars like more than food. I've received a request to collect them. If you're going over there, why don't you go there?
