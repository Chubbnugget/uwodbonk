| **Quest Name** | Flowers that are with people |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a scholar who is researching the Inca Empire. Apparently there are flowers with special meaning in the land over there. It is said that these flowers are given as a sign of celebration, and are also offered to the souls of the dead. He seems to want to know more about the flower. I was hoping to do some research in the city of Lima.
