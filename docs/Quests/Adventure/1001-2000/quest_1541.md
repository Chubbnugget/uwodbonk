### Quest Contents
I hear you found Mayan ruins in the New World. Did you say palenque? We've received another request to investigate the ruins. First, let's hear from a scholar from Seville. ...Does it have something to do with the fact that research teams from all over the world went to investigate the ruins and all returned with gloomy faces?
