| **Quest Name** | Festival flute of the new continent |

### Quest Contents
Apparently, one of the items brought back from the New World the other day was an instrument that produced a clear, beautiful tone. It seems that an artist in town really liked it and wanted one of his own. Would you be willing to accept my request, including researching what kind of instrument it is?
