### Quest Contents
Planning for a trans-Pacific route has also reached a climax. However, it seems that the Fiji Islands are a bit far from the island of Tahiti that you discovered... This time, I would like them to investigate whether there is an island between these two islands and, if so, what that island is. Please ask the Amboina town officials to cooperate again.
