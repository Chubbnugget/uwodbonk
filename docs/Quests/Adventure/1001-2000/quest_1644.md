### Quest Contents
There was a request from the town officials of Amboina to send a navigator who excelled in geographical research. So I think I'll recommend you. Recently, there has been a lot of attention on the continent south of Dili, so I think we should investigate that area... Well, please ask the client for the details of the request.
