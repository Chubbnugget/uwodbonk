### Quest Contents
You discovered a spectacled owl before, right? In fact, there was a boy who heard from a sailor who recently visited a port that ``There is a bear wearing glasses in the New World.'' I thought you would be able to complete this bear investigation, but would you accept my request? *The correct word is "port call" instead of "port call," but the original text remains unchanged.
