| **Quest Name** | Statue of a swift and ferocious animal |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a biologist. Apparently, the Maya and Aztecs had many statues of deified animals, so they would definitely like to get their hands on one. Come to think of it, I heard that there is a statue in the shape of a jaguar near Merida. Why not look for clues locally?
