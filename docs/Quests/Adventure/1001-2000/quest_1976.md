| **Quest Name** | Little Old Man in the Forest |

### Quest Contents
This continent is a treasure trove of rare creatures. However, from time to time, wild rumors sneak in. For example, there's a story about an old man who lives in the Amazon forest and is smaller than a sake bottle. I thought it was a joke, but Giselle at the bar was begging me to look into it. Do you want to check it out?
