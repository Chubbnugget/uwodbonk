### Quest Contents
It was a request from a certain nobleman. It seems that a painter named Lorenzetti left behind a wonderful painting of the Virgin Mary. He wants me to investigate the painting. First of all, I think it would be better to find out where the artist was active. Ask the workshop craftsmen.
