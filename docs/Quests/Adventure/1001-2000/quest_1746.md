This time it's a survey about people living on the island of New Guinea. I heard that Kanoshima is inhabited by people who look completely different from those around here, and that the ecology of flora and fauna is also different. In fact, there was a scholar who showed an interest in the customs of the people on that island. First, talk to the traders in this town.
