### Quest Contents
I heard that there is a continent south of Dili. Moreover, it seems that people have been living here for a long time. Although it is a place that we are interested in, there is only a small amount of interaction between the two countries. So, I asked him to do some basic research on the continent. It seems that there are a few people in Makassar who have gone to the continent. Gather information in advance
