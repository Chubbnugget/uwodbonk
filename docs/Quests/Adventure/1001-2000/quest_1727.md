You were the one who reported on the rainbow-like moonstone seen from underwater and the bright red opal that looked like flickering flames. I have a request to introduce you to someone based on your knowledge of jewelry. This is a survey of stones that make the twinkling stars appear in the night sky.

| **Discovery** | [Treasure](docs/Categories/category_4.md) / [Eternal Stars](docs/Quests/Other/1-1000/quest_846.md) A black opal found only in Australia. Because the background is black, the play of color stands out even more. Its beauty is reminiscent of thousands of stars shining on a moonless night, and when you look at it, you get the feeling of being sucked into the sky when you're alone on a moonless night.
