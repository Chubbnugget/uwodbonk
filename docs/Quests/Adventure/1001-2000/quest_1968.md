### Quest Contents
A strange request comes from a doctor who is writing a book on biology. He asked me to find out about flying crocodiles. They say we're supposed to be on a new continent, but I don't know how serious we should be... Well, it's an official request, so I'll get paid. First of all, why not try Santo Domingo?
