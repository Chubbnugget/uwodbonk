| **Quest Name** | cargo that has washed ashore |

### Quest Contents
A cargo ship departing from this city was wrecked near Havana, and the ship was lost. The fate of the cargo ship is unknown, but apparently the barrels it was carrying were found in London. Why in London? I want you to find out the reason. If you ask Admiral Diaz in Lisbon, you might be able to find out something.
