### Quest Contents
I have a job that I would like to ask you to do. Buddha knows, right? He is the well-known founder of Buddhism. Plans have been floated to recover the Buddha's relics or to locate their whereabouts. I wonder if you can help me with this too. If you can do it, please ask the mayor, Mr. Baile, for details.
