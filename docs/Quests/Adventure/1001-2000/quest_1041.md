### Quest Contents
It's a bit of a creepy investigation, but I'd appreciate your help. Apparently there are jellyfish floating in the sea. Find out where he lives. It is said that it is extremely poisonous, so be careful not to touch it when examining it. It would be a good idea to listen to the story at a bar in Ceuta.
