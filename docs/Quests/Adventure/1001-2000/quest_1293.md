| **Quest Name** | irregular pairs |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a sailor in Jakarta to investigate birds, but the content is rather strange. They would like to find out whether different species of birds can mate. You won't know for sure until you meet the client and listen to the details. Head to Jakarta!
