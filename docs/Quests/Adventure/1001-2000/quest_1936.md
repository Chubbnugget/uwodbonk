| **Quest Name** | God sleeping in the Aztec underworld |

### Quest Contents
I'm sure you've researched the Aztec creation myth. According to the myths passed down by the Aztecs, we are currently in the fifth era, but could you please find out if there are any other stories related to the creation of this fifth world? I think it would be a good idea to check around Veracruz again.
