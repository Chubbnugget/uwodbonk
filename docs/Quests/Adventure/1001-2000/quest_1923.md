# Quest [Bird with dignified eyes]

### Quest [Bird with dignified eyes] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Bird with dignified eyes |

### Quest Contents
Are you the navigator who previously investigated the creatures that live on Sebalt Island? It seems that the subject of this investigation is very similar to that one, but apparently they are not the same species, and their eyes are quite sharp. A sailor in a bar saw it, so please do some research.
