### Quest Contents
This is a request from a scholar in this city. The condition is that you must be a voyageur who has researched reindeer, but I think you'll be fine. You remember the shape of reindeer antlers, right? Apparently they found something that made those magnificent horns blurry. It looks like the palm of a giant. First, please listen to the story in the library.
