| **Quest Name** | All roads lead to Rome |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from an architect from a certain country. It seems that they have been contracted to build a military road, but they would like to find out if there is any road that could be used as a reference for building it. Mr. Martinengo in this town is also an architect, so he might be able to help.
