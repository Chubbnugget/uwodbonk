You're a navigator who previously investigated bears. Well, I have a letter of challenge addressed to you from a workshop craftsman who cooperated with you in the investigation...

| **Notes** | 1. Aden Workshop Craftsman x 3 times 2. Explore the outskirts of Calicut (First search near bandits and imperial soldiers that are in various places. If you are on the edge, it won't shine, but if you are around it, a pillar of light will appear, so search there) 3. Aden Workshop Craftsman (deliver the amulet) *It has been confirmed that the War God's amulet can also be delivered as a bazaar item. The pillar of light appears on the survey map even if you miss it, and it seems to have a fairly wide range (when I discovered it, I dug it near the west swamp, but the place I searched for it was near the center of the map.) The War God's amulet is a time-generated item (3 hours) It seems that there are some conditions other than the prerequisite quest. ↑It seems to be maritime level or maritime fame.
