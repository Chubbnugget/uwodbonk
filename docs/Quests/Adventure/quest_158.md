### Details of the quest [Salmon procurement]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Sourcing salmon |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a workshop craftsman in this town. He wants me to procure 10 barrels of salmon. I guess they are in trouble these days due to poor fishing. The main fishing ground for salmon is the Gulf of Finland, deep in the Baltic Sea. I'll be away for a long time, but please take care of yourself.
