### Quest Contents
I have a request from the adventurer's guild, would you be willing to accept it? I heard from a regular at the rest area that there are blood-sucking creatures living in this area. I would like you to investigate whether that creature is dangerous to humans. If you're a regular who gave me information, I think it's about time you started drinking today.
