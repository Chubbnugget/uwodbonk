| **Quest Name** | Youth of Genius |

### Quest Contents
When do you think people who are called geniuses start showing their talent? I received a request to look into Michelangelo's works from his youth. I wonder just how big it is. I'm sure you can trust the survey results. If you go to Genoa, you'll get some clues.
