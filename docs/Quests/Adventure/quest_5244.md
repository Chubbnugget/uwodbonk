| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Southern Landmark |

### Quest Contents
It was a request from a navigator training school. The landmark that points north in the night sky is the North Star. However, if you go to the southern hemisphere, you won't be able to see the North Star. So, he wants us to investigate whether there are any stars in the southern hemisphere that can serve as direction markers. I'm sure Admiral Diaz of Lisbon would know the details.
