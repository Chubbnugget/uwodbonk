### Quest Contents
A request from the shrine maiden of the empire to you. It seems they want you to give this keep to Chief Chibcha. I don't know the contents, but it seems important. If you want to communicate information about the empire, you should use Chasuki. I wonder if there's a reason? If you can do it, please talk to me again. Give me the keep
