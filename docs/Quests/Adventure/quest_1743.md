### Quest Contents
You're being called by a town official from this town. Apparently, he would like to talk to you about your investigation into the statue at Rapa Nui. You had a long conversation with city officials during the Rapa Nui investigation, right? The town officials seem to be obsessed with that island right now... Well, if you have time, go out with me.

| **Discovery** | [Treasure](Categories/category_4.md) / [Mana](Quests/Other/quest_771.md) [Mana](Quests/Other/quest_771.md) is the power of gods and spirits. This stone seems to contain the power of [Mana] (quest_771.md) so strong that the islanders have avoided even mentioning its existence. When you touch the stone, it feels faintly warm, and it crumbles without making a sound wherever you touch it. Does it mean that it is an existence that cannot be violated by humans?
