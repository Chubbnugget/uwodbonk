### Quest Contents
I've received a request to investigate the story of Zheng Daoden. Historians are said to have become interested in him as a leading figure of the Joseon Dynasty. It seems like he's interested in the political conflict he's been involved in... If I remember correctly, there was a warrior in Pohang, right?

It was heavily used by Lee Seong-gye. Just as Zheng Daoden was planning to send troops to Liaodong, he was assassinated by a political enemy. This poem is said to have been composed on that occasion.
