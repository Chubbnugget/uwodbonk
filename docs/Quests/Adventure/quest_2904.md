### Quest Contents
Once again, this is a request from a young man who is studying religion. He seems to be interested in a certain famous mountain that is different from the one he visited last time. It's famous as a sacred place for Taoism, and it seems like it's a mountain where rituals have been held since ancient times. He wants me to look into the details. Also, I might be able to gather information in Macao.
