### Quest Contents
This is a request from the guild. The torso of a female statue was recently unearthed on the island of Samothrace. However, I can't tell what the statue is just by looking at its torso. A Salonica sculptor is in charge of the restoration work. The request is to help the sculptor and investigate the statue. First, talk to the sculptor in Salonica.
