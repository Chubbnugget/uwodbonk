### Quest Contents
You did some research on boars before, right? It seems that wild boars have recently been released into the New World, but it seems that animals similar to wild boars were originally inhabiting the New World. I've received a request from a sailor in this town to do some research, but if you're interested, would you be willing to come and talk to me?
