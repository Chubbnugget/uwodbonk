### Quest Contents
This was a request from an art dealer. Apparently, a certain artist published a painting depicting the Virgin Mary inside a wreath. The art dealer likes it so much that he wants to buy it. He wants to do some research on the artist because he wants to negotiate directly with him. However, it seems that the touches of the Virgin Mary and the wreath are quite different.
