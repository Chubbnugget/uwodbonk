### Quest [Existence called Sultan] Details

| **Quest Name** | Existence called Sultan |

### Quest Contents
You know it's Sultan. It is a position equivalent to a king in Islamic society. It seems that it has existed since the 11th century, but its significance has changed in various ways. I've received a request to find out the differences between European kings, what do you think? I'm sure there's information on Beirut.
