| **Quest Name** | Ancient Silk Fabric |

### Quest Contents
You did some research on insects that produce silk thread before, right? I'd like to ask you to investigate a certain rumor. A guy traveling through Hangzhou heard a rumor that ancient silk had been found in what appeared to be a tomb. That's a rare thing, and if it were true, the guild wouldn't let it go. Would you mind asking me?
