### Quest Contents
You found the ruins of Troy, right? After all, were the stories of the Trojan War and the Iliad real? The legendary story on the Trojan side is reliable due to the discovery of ruins. But can the Greek side prove it? I'd like to thank you for researching this far. First, try asking at a bar in this town.
