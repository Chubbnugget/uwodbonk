### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a scholar in this city, in recognition of my skill in my previous work. They wanted me to look into the history of the stained glass. Anyway, if I investigate the city of Barcelona in more detail, I wonder if I can find out something? When you're ready, head to Barcelona.
