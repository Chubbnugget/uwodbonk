### Quest Contents
You've seen some of El Greco's paintings. Well then, let's make this request. In the paintings of the school of painting known as Mannerism, including Greco's, the figures are drawn in elongated form. However, it seems that there are some paintings by Mr. Greco that are not like that. Please ask at the workshop.

| **Discovery** | [Artwork](Categories/category_3.md) / [Boy lighting a candle](Quests/Other/quest_533.md) Written by El Greco. This is a masterpiece that captures the tranquil expression of [Boy lighting a candle] (quest_533.md) and the momentary flickering of the fire. It was painted before El Greco went to Spain, and does not use his signature technique of elongating the figures. Unextended picture Rank: 4, Points: 6, Difficulty: 9, Experience points: 720 |
