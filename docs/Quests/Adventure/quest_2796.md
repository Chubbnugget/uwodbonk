| **Quest Name** | young children's study |  

### Quest Contents
There's a request for you from a bigwig in Hangzhou. I would like to find out if there are any teaching materials with good illustrations to help my young son learn morals. Learning morals from an early age makes me look forward to the future even though I am someone else's child. Well, it might be best to ask scholars in Hangzhou about academic matters.
