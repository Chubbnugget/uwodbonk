### Quest Contents
This was a request from a researcher in Oxford. It seems like they're planning to conduct a geographic survey on the continent far west of here, but they're having trouble finding research colleagues who are capable enough to go that far. If you want to help, the port official in this town should have a message for you, so go see him.
