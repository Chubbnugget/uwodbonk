### Quest Contents
Yo, how are you doing? A map maker asked me to do this after hearing that you were making good progress in researching the Northeast Passage. It seems that they want to draw a detailed map of the strait that lies ahead along the northern route all the way to the east. I think I'll be away for a while, but I'd appreciate your help.
