| **Quest Name** | Giant Round Rock |  

### Quest Contents
I received a request to investigate a strange rock. Well, I'm sure it's not normal when the request comes. It seems to be made of round rocks about the size of a person. I wonder if a scholar of Anping would be able to understand the details.
