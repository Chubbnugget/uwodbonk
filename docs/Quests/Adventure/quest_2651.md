| **Quest Name** | Cowardly Animal |

### Quest Contents
Do you like deer? Well, a trader who went to Pohang apparently saw a deer-like animal on the outskirts of the city. But it seems like it was a little different from the deer. I'm still wondering what that is. First of all, please ask the person who is staying there.
