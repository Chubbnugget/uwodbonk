| **Quest Name** | Luck brought by the icy sea |

### Quest Contents
The client in question has asked us to discover a ``land of grapes''. It seems that the story of a fleet that was lost due to bad weather led to Erik's son reaching the ``Land of Grapes'' from the ``farthest reaches'', but that sea is icy. Looks like it's going to be a difficult request.
