### Quest Contents
Have you been to the Caribbean many times? The plants growing there are quite different from here. I'm currently receiving a request to survey plants in the Caribbean. There are rumors that there is a mysterious flower that only smells at night, but I don't know the details. Ask me at a bar in Santo Domingo.
