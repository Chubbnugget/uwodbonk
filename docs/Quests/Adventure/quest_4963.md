### Quest Contents
This was a request from an astronomer. It seems that a new constellation has been established in the Netherlands, so I would like you to find out what kind of constellation it is. It's a constellation created in the Netherlands, so if you go to Amsterdam, you'll probably find someone who knows about it.
