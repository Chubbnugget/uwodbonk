### Details of the quest [Brahman Priest's Scripture]

| **Quest Name** | Brahman priest's scripture |  

### Quest Contents
In ancient India, there were three sacred texts called the Vedas. However, the number later increased to four. This time, please look into this fourth Veda. It seems that it is completely different from other Vedas, but I wonder why. It would be a good idea to consult the scholars of Calicut first.
