### Quest Contents
A request has come from Giselle at the bar. Well...what... Because I didn't really understand what it meant. Since you're friends with Giselle, I'm sure you'll understand what I mean...or rather, I'm sure you'll be happy to accept. I said something like, ``I want a flame,'' but I don't know what it is.
