### Quest Contents
This is a request from a child in this town. It's like, "I'm going to become a knight! I want a horse as a companion!" At least in this town, I don't think there are any horses that small children can ride...well, this is also a request. Could you please ask the trainer in Marseille if he has any horses for children?
