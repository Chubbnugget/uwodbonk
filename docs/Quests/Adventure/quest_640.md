| **Quest Name** | Twelve tapestries |

### Quest Contents
A gorgeous tapestry is as impressive as a painting. This is a request to investigate such a work. What I'm looking for is a series of twelve pieces called ``Maximilian's Hunt.'' The workshop craftsmen in Antwerp will probably know more about this kind of thing.
