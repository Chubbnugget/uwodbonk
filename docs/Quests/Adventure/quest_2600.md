### Quest Contents
Have you ever heard of it? Rumor has it that there are paintings of "human-like animals" in an island country north of Manila... I received a request from a certain art collector to find that person. If you're in Sakai, where people and things gather, you'll probably be able to get information as well. Would you like to try this job?
