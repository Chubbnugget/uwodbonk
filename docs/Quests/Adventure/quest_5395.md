### Quest Contents
I've received a request for you. The job seems to involve gathering information. This is an important matter under the care of the adventurer's guild master in London, so please ask him directly for the details. You might be worried if you don't understand the content, but if you just listen to the story, you'll feel at ease, right? First of all, that's all I ask.

Explore west Candia (immediately north of the landing site entrance, around the area where Tradescant was) Note: It is not inland Crete, but west Candia. *There are other quests with the same name in London (assuming the discovery of "Xanadu") and Amsterdam (assuming the discovery of "Siberian Husky").
