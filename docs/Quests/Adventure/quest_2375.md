### Quest Contents
A request from a trader in this city. It seems that the trader has received an order for a dog that is easy to keep from a nobleman in the Low Countries. I'd like to bring something rare with me. That's why we asked a navigator who was familiar with living things to investigate. Well, I asked the client for details.
