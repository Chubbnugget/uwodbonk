| **Quest Name** | star approaching the sun |

### Quest Contents
Do you know the rumors that are often heard in this town these days? The story goes that the sun and a certain star will collide. I'm sure that I know about stars that move closer to the sun every day, but I don't think that's true... right? Ah, I'm already curious, so please look into it. Anyone from Oxford would know.
