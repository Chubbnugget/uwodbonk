# Quest [Brother Star]

### Quest [Brother Star] Details

| **Quest Name** | Brother Star |

### Quest Contents
I've received another request from an aspiring astrologer. This time, he wants us to investigate and find the reason behind Gemini. I always get bored with Greek myths, so if possible, I would like you to look into other myths. If you're a bar master, you might know something interesting.
