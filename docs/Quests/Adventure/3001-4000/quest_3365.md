### Details of the quest [A Beloved Cat and a Girl's Request]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | A beloved cat and girl's request |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever been to the city of Hormuz? I received a request from a merchant who was staying there, and asked me to come as soon as possible. It's not just a dream that new animal hair will be a hit at the trading post!　That's what I was saying... Please ask the person himself for details. Apparently he's at Hormuz's rest area.
