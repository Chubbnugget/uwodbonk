# Quest [Voodoo God]

### Quest [Voodoo God] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Voodoo God |

### Quest Contents
I've got a request from a young man in this town. He wanted me to find out about the god of voodoo. I heard that Voodoo is a religion that originated in the Caribbean, but I wonder why people here would want to research it... I think it would be better to hear from him first.
