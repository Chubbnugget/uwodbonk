# Quest [Goat and Fish Constellation]

### Quest [Goat and Fish Constellation] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Goat and Fish Constellation |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever seen a picture of Capricorn? I wonder why the lower half of his body is like a fish. That's strange. That's why I've received another request from an aspiring astrologer to investigate and observe the origin of Capricorn. Mr. El Greco of Seville might know something.
