# Details of the quest [Approaching the "Ultimates"]

### Details of the quest [Approaching the "Ultimates"]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Approaching the “end” |

### Quest Contents
I have received a request for further research regarding the Viking voyages from my client, a folklorist. Now that they know the exact location of the ``Ice Island'' that Eirika found, they want us to identify the ``extreme edge.'' Increasing clues little by little will help prove that the story is historical fact.

| **Discovery** | [Geography](docs/Categories/category_2.md) / [Greenland](docs/Quests/Adventure/1-1000/quest_255.md) An island located northwest of Iceland. Obstructed by ice sheets and perpetual snow, it is impossible to see the details of the island. They can only live in small parts of the coast where there is no ice. However, the Vikings called this land the "Green Country" and invited settlers. Approaching the "end" Rank: 5, Points: 8, Difficulty: 12, Experience points: 1,100 |
