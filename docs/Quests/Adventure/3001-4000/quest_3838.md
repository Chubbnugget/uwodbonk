| **Quest Name** | Seeking new territory |

### Quest Contents
I heard it. I heard you were asked to conduct a sea survey of the west coast of North America. There's someone who wants to ask such an experienced navigator for help in developing North America, what do you think? If you are interested, please talk to the client himself at a bar in this town. The client is a woman who wears unusual clothes, so I think you'll be able to tell right away if you go there.

Justine, San Francisco (to the right as you face the bank) Prerequisites: If you have received permission to enter a port in East Asia and have completed a marine survey in the North Sea, you must receive permission to enter a port on the west coast of North America from Mercator in Amsterdam. Does not appear with 0 adventure fame. It came out in 342. The only language available is French (notes available). Strategy: You can take a regular boat from Panama or Lima to San Francisco. You will not be able to enter the port until you have completed the event on the west coast of the North American continent, but you will be able to go out to sea near San Francisco, saving you the trouble of traveling from Central America etc. on your own. During Thanksgiving, you can also take the Continental Railroad from Omaha directly to the west coast of North America. Justine Episode 1 Bonus Quest Thursday |
