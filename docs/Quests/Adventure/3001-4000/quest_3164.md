| **Quest Name** | Meaning of the Mountain |

### Quest Contents
It's a request from a certain pioneer. While checking the topography of the northern part of the continent, it seems that they found a certain mountain. However, it's strangely flat for a mountain, and they think it might be a ruin, so they'd like to request an investigation. If it was a ruin, it would be a major one. Apparently the Merida scholar knows something.
