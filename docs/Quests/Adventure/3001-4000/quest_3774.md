| **Quest Name** | sheep shining in the sky |

### Quest Contents
You've received another request from an aspiring astrologer. This time, they want to find out the origin of Aries, one of the zodiac constellations, and find it in the night sky. I don't think they're going to ask for all the 12 constellations... For now, it would be a good idea to gather information in Athens.
