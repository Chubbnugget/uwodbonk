# Quest [Nomads' Dwelling]

### Quest Contents
I heard from my client that nomads move around with their homes. Wouldn't it be amazing if the adventurer guild could also move freely... No, let's put that aside. This is a request for an investigation regarding that residence. You can go to Xanadu, right? I asked for an on-site investigation.
