| **Quest Name** | Copernicus' request |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from Mr. Copernicus of Danzig. They would like to request you to observe a certain planet. It seems that the person in question will explain the details, but I guess that's why he can't tell me. If you accept, please go to Danzig and meet Mr. Copernicus.
