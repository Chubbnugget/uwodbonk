# Quest [Pirate Symbol]

### Quest [Pirate Symbol] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Pirate Symbol |

### Quest Contents
I've received another request from a writer who previously asked me to do some research for a novel about pirates. This time, he seems to want to know about things that are symbolic of pirates. The location is Port Royal again this time. As a guild, we're a bit saddened by all the requests to go to dangerous towns, but... will you go?
