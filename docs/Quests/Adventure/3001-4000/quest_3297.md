# Quest [Failed Student]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Failed Student |

### Quest Contents
If you have free time, could you lend me a hand? I've been asked by a university professor in Oxford to persuade a former student of mine to take part in a lecture. It seems that the London guild has also had trouble with it, so it must be quite a formidable enemy. Please ask the adventurer guild master in London for details.
