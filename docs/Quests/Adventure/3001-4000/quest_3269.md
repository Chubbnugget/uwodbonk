### Quest Contents
When you think of deserts in Africa, you think of the Sahara Desert, but there are also deserts in the south of the continent, right? This time, I'll ask you to investigate the desert. Apparently it's necessary for scholars to study geology. I think the official at the departure point in Benguela will tell you more.
