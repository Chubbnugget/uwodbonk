### Quest Contents
This request came from a young man who is interested in Russian history. Although he is interested, he doesn't seem to know where to start... Are you good at this kind of historical research? Complete the request quickly and set an example for the young people. Well, I guess I should consult a scholar in St. Petersburg first.
