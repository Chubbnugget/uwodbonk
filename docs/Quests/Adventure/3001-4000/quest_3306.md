| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | A farmer's daughter's filial piety |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a farmer's daughter in this town. In order to help her father with his work, he seems to want to borrow the help of someone who knows a lot about plants. Apparently, the fields that her father cultivates have recently become thinner and the harvest is decreasing, which is a problem. Even though it must be difficult to prepare a reward, she is a filial daughter. Please lend me your hand.
