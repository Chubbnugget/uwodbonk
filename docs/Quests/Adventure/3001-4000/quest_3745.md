# Quest [North Star and Dipper]

### Quest [North Star and Dipper] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | North Star and Dipper |

### Quest Contents
You've found your North Star. We have received an additional request from a university in Oxford. Apparently there is a "dipper" that can be used to find the North Star. Why is a ladle useful for finding stars? Well, I think it's best to ask the fishermen here. Why not try looking for it in Lisbon?
