### Quest Contents
You seem to be used to researching creatures in the far north. I've read some interesting research reports. I have a job that I would like to ask you to do. It seems that they are investigating a certain whale, but please ask the client, a scholar in this city, for more details. I'm looking forward to reporting this time as well.
