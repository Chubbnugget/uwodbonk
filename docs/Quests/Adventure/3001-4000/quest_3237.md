| **Quest Name** | Survey of fishing grounds in the southern part of the Italian peninsula |

### Quest Contents
There's a depression right on the land in the southern part of the Italian peninsula, right? Apparently Asoga is a good fishing ground, so I'd like you to find out what it's like. If I remember correctly, Ancona's tavern master was fishing in that area. Listen to the story and deliver it to the Bar Master in Naples.
