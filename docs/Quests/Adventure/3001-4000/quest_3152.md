| **Quest Name** | Lorenzo's Collectibles |

### Quest Contents
We have received requests from craft craftsmen to investigate their crafts. It seems that Mr. Lorenzo from Florence has been collecting certain things recently, and he wants me to look into them. ...I feel like that person has collected quite a lot of different monsters... For now, why not consult with the director of the museum in Paris?
