### Details of the quest [Constellation made in Germany]

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | constellations made in germany |

### Quest Contents
Constellations have been around since ancient times. However, it seems that some new constellations have been created recently. This time I've been asked to look into one of them. It seems that the constellation was created in Germany, so I think Mr. Kepler from Frankfurt might know something about it.
