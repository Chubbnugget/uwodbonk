| **Quest Name** | North American Song |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a folklorist. There is a song that is often sung on the west coast of North America, and I would like to find out its origin and the meaning of the lyrics. A big city on the west coast of North America...well, if you go to San Francisco, you might be able to find some clues.
