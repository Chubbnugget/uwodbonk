### Quest Contents
You've done a lot of research on ancient doctors. According to one passage, the doctor Hippocrates seems to have descended from even more amazing doctors. A certain scholar has asked me to look into the legends of that doctor. It would be a good idea to ask Mr. Paré in Bordeaux first.
