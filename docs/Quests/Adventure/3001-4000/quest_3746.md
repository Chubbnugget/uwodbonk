### Quest Contents
You've been commissioned by a university in Oxford. They want to start from the Big Dipper, which they observed earlier, and look for landmarks to find other constellations. Apparently there is a traveling scholar in Valencia who is knowledgeable about the starry sky, so you should go and ask him about it.
