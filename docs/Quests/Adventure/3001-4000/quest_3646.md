| **Quest Name** | Living in the grassland area |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever been to a city called Xanadu on the east side of this continent? A scholar in this city heard rumors about you and asked you to find out more about the lives of the people living in Xanadu. If you're willing to accept, I think it would be a good idea to first gather information at Mt. Undai, which is near the site.
