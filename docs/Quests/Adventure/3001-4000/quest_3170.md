# Quest [Grandfather's Portrait]

### Quest [Grandfather's Portrait] Details

| **Quest Name** | Grandfather's Portrait |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a young lady staying in Florence. I didn't find any Medici tableware, but apparently I saw something else that was rare. That's something I'm curious about now. Well, please ask the person himself for the details.
