### Quest Contents
This is a request from an aspiring astrologer. They want you to research the origin of Scorpio and find its constellation. A Scorpio woman sounds kind of scary, doesn't it? I feel like I'll get stabbed if I'm not careful. Actually, my wife too... no, that's fine. Just ask the young man in Algiers.
