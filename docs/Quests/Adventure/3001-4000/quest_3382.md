| **Quest Name** | Another name for Noah |

### Quest Contents
I hear you're involved in the research into Mesopotamian civilization that scholars in this city and Seville are so passionate about? I've got another request. It seemed like they were researching the Old Testament and the Epic of Gilgamesh. For now, please listen to the details from a scholar in this town.
