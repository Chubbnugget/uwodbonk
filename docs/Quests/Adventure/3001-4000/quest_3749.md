# Quest [Ecliptic Goddess]

### Quest [Ecliptic Goddess] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Ecliptic Goddess |

### Quest Contents
You've received a request from an aspiring astrologer. They would like you to investigate the origin of Virgo, one of the zodiac constellations, and observe it. When I think about it again, I wonder who the "virgin" is. I'm sure it's someone from Greek mythology. I think the theologians of Nantes are familiar with this kind of story.
