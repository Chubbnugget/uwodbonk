### Quest Contents
I've received a request for you from a customer who hangs out at a bar in Santo Domingo. It seems to be a request to find a pearl related to the Conch Gai that you found earlier. It seems like I would like you to go to Port Royal, can I ask you to do so? If you accept, I'll tell you the details.
