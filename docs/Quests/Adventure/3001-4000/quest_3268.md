| **Quest Name** | a tree that blooms with flames |

### Quest Contents
Apparently a biologist was researching flowers in West Africa, but his report was exposed to seawater before it reached the scientists in town. They would like to request an investigation to supplement the report. I'll ask my client, a scholar, for more details. I'll be waiting for you in the library.
