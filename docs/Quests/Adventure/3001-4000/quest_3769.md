| **Quest Name** | Ancient Great Comet |

### Quest Contents
Do you know what a comet is? It's a star with a trailing tail, and it rarely appears and disappears within a few months. A request regarding the comet has come from a certain scholar. He wants me to look into the records of comets left by ancient people. I wonder if there's something left around Italy.
