| **Quest Name** | Route survey near Nassau |

### Quest Contents
Would you be willing to help the guild with its route investigation? When heading from here to the northern continent via the Caribbean Sea, you will inevitably pass around pirate islands like Nassau. That's dangerous, so I'm gathering information on nearby islands and considering the route. If you can help me, please talk to me again.
