### Details of the quest [An archer aiming for a scorpion]

| **Quest Name** | archer aiming at scorpion |

### Quest Contents
Another request has come from an aspiring astrologer. They want people to research the origin of Sagittarius, one of the zodiac constellations, and actually find it in the night sky. Since he's sitting there, I'm sure he's holding a bow, but I wonder what he's aiming at. Why not talk to a Neapolitan scholar?
