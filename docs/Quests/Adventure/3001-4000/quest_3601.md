### Quest [Jewel Hidden in the Sea] Details

| **Quest Name** | Jewel Hidden in the Sea |

### Quest Contents
Do you go to the Caribbean often? There's a scholar who studies that area, and he asked me to look into its safety. It would be a joke to conduct a safety survey in the pirate-infested Caribbean. It seems that a scholar in this city is asking for details from a client.

Apparently, the bottom of the shallow water is deeper in that part, like a gaping hole, which makes the sea appear darker in color. I wonder how far this hole connects...
