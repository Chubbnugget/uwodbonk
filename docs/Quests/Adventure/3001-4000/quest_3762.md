### Details of the quest [Hohin Palace Investigation]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Investigation of Hohin Palace |

### Quest Contents
I've received another request from an aspiring astrologer. The next step is to find out the origin of Aquarius, one of the zodiac constellations, and find it in the night sky. I wonder how many times I'll see this. If you ask François Rabelais, who lives in Marseille, he might be able to tell you something.
