### Details of the quest [Settlement investigation]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Survey of villages |

### Quest Contents
An old village believed to be indigenous was recently discovered on the Colorado Plateau. I've received a request for assistance from a folklorist who's doing research there, but could I ask you to help? It seems they would like to ask a navigator who has experience investigating indigenous villages. If you're willing to do it, head directly to the Colorado Plateau.
