### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. There's a constellation shaped like Sicily, so I'd like you to look it up. Sicily is an island in the Mediterranean Sea. I'm sure there was a city called Syracuse. I think there's someone out there who knows something.

| **Discovery** | [Astronomy](docs/Categories/category_18.md) / [Triangulum](docs/Quests/Other/2001-3000/quest_2415.md) It is said that Ceres, the guardian deity of Sicily and the goddess of agriculture, asked Zeus to raise the shape of Sicily to the sky as a constellation. Although it is a small constellation with no bright stars, it is easy to distinguish because there are no bright stars around it.
