### Details of the quest [Great Power's Thoughts]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Thoughts of a great power |

### Quest Contents
Mr. Wallenstein from Rome has requested you. He said he wanted to discuss the details of his request directly. Also, it seems like you're in quite a hurry and there's a time limit for completing it, so be careful. I trust him because it's a request from a famous mercenary captain, but political speculation is swirling around him. Please forgive me for all the trouble.
