### Quest Contents
A traveler has asked me to research the city of Paris. He stopped in Paris during his trip, but his stay was so short that he wasn't able to explore it as much as he wanted. It seems like he hasn't even set foot in that museum. Please obtain information from the museum director that will make the client want to visit Paris again.
