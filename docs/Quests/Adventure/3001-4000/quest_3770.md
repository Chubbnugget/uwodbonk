### Quest Contents
Lately, a red star has been shining brightly in the night sky. I've received a request to investigate that red star. The client is Mr. Kepler from Frankfurt. Apparently, they want a third party to help with observations in order to verify their hypothesis. Could you please ask the person in question for details?
