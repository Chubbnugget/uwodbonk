| **Quest Name** | Ice Sea World |

### Quest Contents
...It seems like you're determined to head for the northern route, right? I occasionally see drift ice around here, but the drift ice floating on the northern shipping route is something else. Apparently, there is a huge mountain of ice floating in the sea that looks like an island. This time, I would like to ask the Adventurer's Guild to investigate the ice mountain. Please check from a nearby area.
