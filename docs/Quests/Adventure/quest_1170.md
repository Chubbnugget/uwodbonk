### Details of the quest [Daughter taken by Cortes]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Daughter of Cortes |

### Quest Contents
I think I asked for a request from the priest who was collecting Cortez's belongings before, but I've received another request regarding that matter. It seems that they have also started collecting the belongings of those who are siding with Cortez. We try not to get involved with those kinds of people too much, so I don't have any information... Isn't there anyone who knows more?
