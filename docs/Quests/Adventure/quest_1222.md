| **Quest Name** | Mayan Art |

### Quest Contents
Many of the artifacts excavated from Mayan town ruins are of luxurious construction. It must have been a rich life. I received a request from a group of craftsmen who wanted to recreate something from the past, asking me to search for Mayan artistic relics. Is there any information on the departure point?
