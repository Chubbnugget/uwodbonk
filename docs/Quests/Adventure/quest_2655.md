### Quest Contents
A nobleman whose hobby is collecting insects hears about a butterfly that lives in the Korean region, and requests that he catch it. I've also heard of butterflies that have holes in their wings. It's strange because it still flies. I heard that there is a land south of Hanyang, so I thought I'd go there.
