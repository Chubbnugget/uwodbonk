### Quest [Beauty Standards] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Beauty Standards |

### Quest Contents
In Greek and Hellenistic art, depicting the naked figure was a way to approach the divine image and pursue the ideal. However, in Catholic societies such as Italy and France, it seems that expressing nudity is prohibited from an ethical standpoint. We've received a request to investigate this matter. Check it out in Genoa.

| **Discovery** | [Artwork](Categories/category_3.md) / [Venus of Urbino](Quests/Other/quest_540.md) Made by Titian. Venus, who is lying in the foreground, directs her gaze towards me, as if to provoke the viewer. The puppy curled up at her feet symbolizes obedience and chastity, and the rose in her hand symbolizes love. A maid searching the wardrobe of an aristocratic mansion makes the goddess feel worldly.
