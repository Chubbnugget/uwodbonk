### Quest Contents
The burial clothes of an ancient king were recently discovered in Hangzhou. It seems that academic research is still in progress in Hangzhou, and there is almost no information coming through the guild. A scholar in this town says he wants to know just the current situation. I'd like you to get permission from the Hangzhou city officials and gather some information.
