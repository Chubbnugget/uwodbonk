### Quest Contents
There is a story that a statue of Ares, the Greek god of war, was seen near Athens. It will be quite a treasure if you find it. Just saying it's in the suburbs is just a bit of information, isn't it? Wouldn't it be a good idea to get some information from the Athenian scholars first?
