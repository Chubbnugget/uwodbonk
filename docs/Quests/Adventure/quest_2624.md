### Quest Contents
Oh, it's you. Do you remember when I asked you to do a geographical survey of Taiwan Island? You did a pretty good job last time. There's something I'd like you to investigate again. Next time, I would like you to collect information about rivers in Anping. I would also like information on residents' awareness and attractions.
