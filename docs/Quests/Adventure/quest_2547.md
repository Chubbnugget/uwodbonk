| **Quest Name** | Bird chasing request |

### Quest Contents
It seems you've found a bird called an ibis. Apparently, the girl in Edo has something she would like to ask about the bird. I don't know the details, but it seems like it's a job you can't ask people living around Edo to do. Here's one thing, can you please take off your clothes?
