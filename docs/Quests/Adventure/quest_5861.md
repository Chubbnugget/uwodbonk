| **Quest Name** | If there is a Tale of Genji |

### Quest Contents
There were some people who really liked the story you reported on, ``The Tale of Genji.'' He asked me, ``It's said that Japan had powerful clans called the Minamoto and Taira clans, so isn't there a story about the Taira clan?'' I don't think it's that easy... Could you please go to Sakai and investigate?
