### Quest Contents
I knew that there were a surprising number of foolish men who fell in love with bar girls, but I never expected... No, just pretend you didn't hear that. This time the request came from a sailor at a bar. Apparently there is some consultation regarding bar girls in Lima. Will you listen to me?
