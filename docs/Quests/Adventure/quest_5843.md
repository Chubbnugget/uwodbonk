| **Quest Name** | River of Two Colors |  

### Quest Contents
Rivers are usually a single color, right? No, I'm not making fun of you, but I heard a rumor that there is a river of two colors in the interior of Europe. If it's not artificial, I'm curious about how it works. Could you please check it out? I might be able to find something around Bordeaux.
