### Details of the quest [Yamamusume's protection request]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Yamamusume protection request |  

### Quest Contents
Are you the navigator who investigated Yamamusume? I received a request from Takehiro in Tamsui, asking me to protect an injured Yamamusume. Even though the people of the city tried to protect it, they were wary and tried to force it to fly. It seems like I can't approach them carelessly. I heard the rest directly from the client.
