# Quest [That's a different story]

| **Quest Name** | That's a different story |  

### Quest Contents
I'm talking about the altarpiece you found the other day. It seems to be a legend that came from the East, but when I asked a navigator in Athens, he said, ``That's a completely different story from here.'' I believe that Mr. El Greco of Seville was also from the East. ...I'm sorry, but could you please hear from him?
