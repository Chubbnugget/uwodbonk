# Quest [Frozen Sea]


### Quest [Frozen Sea] Details

### Quest Contents
Have you ever been north of Stockholm? The small island to the north is a good fishing ground for salmon, and fishing boats often come out. However, the map is still incomplete. The sea freezes in the winter, so we need up-to-date maps for safety. Could you please check something out?
