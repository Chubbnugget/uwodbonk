| **Discovery** | [Artwork](Categories/category_3.md) / [Portrait of a Man in a Red Turban](Quests/Adventure/quest_656.md) Written by Jan van Eyck. Although there are various theories, it is said to be a depiction of Eyck himself. By improving his previous painting methods, he was able to draw in as much detail as in this painting, and succeeded in expressing deep and varied light and shade.
