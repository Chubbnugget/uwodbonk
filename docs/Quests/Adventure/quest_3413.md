### Quest Contents
You seem to be familiar with historical sites north of here. There's a job the guild would like to ask you to do. Apparently there is something called a ``Ship Grave'' on the British Isles. I wonder what kind of grave it is... If you're a sailor, you'll probably be interested, too, right? Please do some research in London.
