# Quest [Hometown of Yellow Wind]

### Quest [Hometown of Yellow Wind] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Hometown of Yellow Wind |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a bard staying in Oxford. He heard a rumor that yellow wind blows in the Far East, and wants to know the details. It's a rumor that sounds like a fairy tale, but I think it would be better to hear the details from the person himself.
