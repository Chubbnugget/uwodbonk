| **Quest Name** | Las Palmas city information |  

### Quest Contents
It was a request from the Seville guards. It seems that a certain nobleman from Seville is thinking of moving to Las Palmas. So, I would like to hear the opinions of the people who actually live there about what kind of city it is. Departure station officials often come from different countries, so wouldn't it be a good idea to ask them?
