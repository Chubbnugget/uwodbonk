| **Quest Name** | Securing the Arabian route |

### Quest Contents
Arabia was now completely under the influence of the Ottoman Turks. If the sea routes around that area were occupied, business would increase. That's why I've been told that they want to make a detailed map of Arabia. Sneak into Aden and get some information.
