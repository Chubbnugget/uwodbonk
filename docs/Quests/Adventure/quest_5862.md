### Quest Contents
Children love small animals, right? A girl in this town has asked me to find out if there is a constellation of such cute creatures. ...There aren't really any bad legends related to constellations. Speaking of constellations, they're all about Greek mythology, and you'll probably find someone in Athens who knows about them.
