### Quest Contents
A certain young man once told me that there were moving yellow lines on the trees on the island of Taiwan. I thought it was just a joke, but the person in question was very serious. He said he wanted to know the truth, so I accepted the request. Are you looking for it? I heard the details from the adventurer request intermediary in Anping.
