### Details of the quest [Language barrier that stands in your way]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | The language barrier that stands in your way |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a young aristocrat in this city, but I'm going to trust you because you're used to researching things. Actually, the client wants to know why there are language differences in this world. I have no idea how to find out... Maybe it would be a good idea to ask him what his intentions are.
