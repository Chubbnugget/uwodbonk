### Quest Contents
Looks like you've done some research on the Cape York Peninsula. Well then, I think it's time to start investigating the east coast of the continent. Do some interviews in Kakadu, and if you find any distinctive terrain, try investigating that area. It's a continent that leaves many parts unknown. You might find something amazing!
