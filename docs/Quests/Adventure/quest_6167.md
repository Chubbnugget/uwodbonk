| **Quest Name** | Origin of hagiography |

### Quest Contents
There are various traditions about saints passed down in the church, so it must be a bit of a struggle just to understand them. That's why I received a request from a priest in Dublin. There is a book that compiles many hagiographical stories into one book, so please be sure to order it. Head to Dublin now.
