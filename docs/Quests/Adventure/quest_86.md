# Quest [Egyptian Queen]

### Quest [Egyptian Queen] Details

| **Quest Name** | Egyptian Queen |

### Quest Contents
I heard some interesting stories from comedians who travel from city to city. It is said that there is a magical flute in Egypt that can seduce people's hearts with its wonderful tone. If you're interested in old musical instruments, I think this is the perfect information for you.
