# Quest [Sea Tea Party]


### Quest [Sea Tea Party] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Sea Tea Party |  

### Quest Contents
Apparently there was a fight between tea merchants and local residents in Boston. It doesn't seem like it was a very large scale, but tea leaves are a valuable item. The guild needs to be careful so that it doesn't become a big incident. I'm sorry, but could you please investigate? It seems that the merchant has already returned to London.
