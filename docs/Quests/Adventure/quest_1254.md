| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | A place near the storm |

### Quest Contents
This area is often hit by severe storms from summer to fall. There are also many victims of shipwrecks. Therefore, it was decided to build a lighthouse to warn of signs of storms and serve as a landmark for voyagers. I would like you to search for that candidate location. Please talk to the bar master first.
