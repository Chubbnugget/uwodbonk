### Quest Contents
It was a request from a musician in town. Apparently, he heard a strange-looking man from somewhere far away playing and reciting an epic poem, and fell in love with the sound of the instrument. I have received a request to find out what kind of instrument it is. If you want to accept a request, you should first ask the scholars in town.
