| **Quest Name** | Father's Lute |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from Mr. Gesualdo from Naples. I'd like you to do some research on Italian lute players... I wonder why they asked Athens instead of Naples... Why don't you ask Muliney at the bar first? There was also the matter of the harp.
