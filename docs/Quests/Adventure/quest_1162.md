### Quest Contents
It's a bit of a hassle, but apparently European aristocrats are coming to this area soon. It seems that their destination is the beautiful Caribbean sea, and they have been asked to find a particularly special place. Would you mind looking for it? Just ask a sailor while he's drinking at a bar.
