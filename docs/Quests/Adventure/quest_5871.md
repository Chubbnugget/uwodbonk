| **Quest Name** | stick-like fish |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever been to Japan, which is west of here? Then, do you know about the stick-like fish that lives around there? Apparently it's a rare species that can only be seen in that area. I've received a request to investigate this guy, but if you're willing to accept it, please head to Edo right away.
