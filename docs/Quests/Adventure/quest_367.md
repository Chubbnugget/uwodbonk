### Quest Contents
Oh, it's you. I've received another job request from Mr. Da Vinci. It seems that his research will be completed with this survey. Well, since it's the last one, the content is probably quite difficult, so you'd better be prepared. It may sound boring, but please try not to be rude when talking to him.
