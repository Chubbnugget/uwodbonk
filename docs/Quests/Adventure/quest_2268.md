| **Quest Name** | The sound of stones echoing in the ruins |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a scholar who is investigating the ruins of Pompeii Island. When I landed on the island the other day to investigate, I heard a sound that sounded like something was being smashed. According to the report, there was no one there, so I wondered why... Scholars say they can rest assured if they understand the true nature of the sound. As for that island... it's that person.
