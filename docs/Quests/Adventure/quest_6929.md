### Quest Contents
Did you know that aristocratic ladies wear flowers in their hair? Lately, it seems like there has been a lot of competition to see how rare flowers can attract attention. Today, I received another request to find a new type of flower. If you're willing to accept it, please talk to the noble lady in this town.
