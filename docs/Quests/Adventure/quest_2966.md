### Quest Contents
That's a bit of a strange request. The other day, a navigator who was surveying the land north of the Caribbean Sea apparently saw a hairball moving at high speed. He would like to ask someone in the industry who is knowledgeable about biology to investigate. The client seems to believe that the hairball is a living thing. I hope there's a clue in this town's archives...
