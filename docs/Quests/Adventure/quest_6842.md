### Quest Contents
It seems like you've been doing a lot of research around the Bay of Bengal. Have you climbed the Himalayas? I would like to ask you to investigate the lower reaches of the Ganges River. It seems that two major rivers flow in downstream, creating a delta, but what is the Brahmaputra River and the other one? Listen to the details in Calcutta.
