### Quest Contents
Have you ever really seen a picture of a dragon? I don't think it really exists, but apparently there is an animal in the Caribbean that seems to be a baby dragon. If that's true, that would be a great discovery... It seems dangerous, but could you please look into it? I hear it's about Jamaica, ask at the bar there.
