# Quest [Aztec Night God]

### Quest [Aztec Night God] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Aztec Night God |

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. I was researching the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca and collected statues, but apparently they were taken away by thieves. If possible, I would like you to look for the same one, but it seems that you can also find a different one. If you want to know about the Aztecs, you should probably ask about it in Veracruz.
