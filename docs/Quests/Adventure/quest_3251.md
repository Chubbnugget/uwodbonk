| **Quest Name** | Beautiful flowers blooming in the arena |

### Quest Contents
Did you know that there are rumors about a beautiful woman dressed as a man appearing in the Roman arena? It seems that Roman officials, who had a hunch that an incident would occur due to the topicality of the incident, wanted to clarify this person's identity and ask him to leave the area as soon as possible. I would like to ask you to investigate the area around Rome. There seem to be a lot of eyewitness accounts, so I'm sure there will be some information at the bar.
