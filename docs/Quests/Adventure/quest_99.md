# Quest [Caesar's Sword]

### Quest [Caesar's Sword] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Caesar's Sword |

### Quest Contents
I've received some interesting information. Apparently there's a sword that Caesar used. Caesar is also closely related to the Celts you are researching. There may be some interesting material left. Speaking of Caesar... It would be a good idea to visit the archives on the Italian peninsula.
