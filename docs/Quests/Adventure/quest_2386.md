### Quest Contents
You can get some interesting information from the peddlers in this town. During my trip from Nagasaki, I saw an insect with a snail shell on its head. They ask me to research about the insect. Don't you think this will lead to new discoveries? It might be a good idea to talk to the client and look for it.
