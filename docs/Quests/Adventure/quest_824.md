| **Quest Name** | Are there any shallow waters where anyone can fish? |

### Quest Contents
I have a favor to ask of you, the navigator. Are there any good fishing grounds off the coast of the North Sea? There are a lot of people asking me to teach them, so I'm at a loss. I guess you can catch more fish in shallow water. I'm sure you can find out right away.
