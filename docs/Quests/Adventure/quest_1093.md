### Quest Contents
Have you gotten used to the Caribbean? There are so many islands that I probably won't be able to remember them all. The investigation is not making much progress, so I would like to ask you a favor. The current investigation request is for an island located in the southwestern part of Cuba. Gather information at Santiago's bar, then head out to investigate.
