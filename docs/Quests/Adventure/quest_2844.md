### Quest Contents
You're the one who was asked by Brunei's gatekeeper to investigate weapons on Taiwan Island. Apparently, a scholar appeared in Brunei with something very similar to that weapon. A weapon craftsman asked me to investigate this matter. It seems to be about the history of the continent called Romance of the Three Kingdoms, so I would really like you to do this research.
