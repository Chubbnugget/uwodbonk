### Quest Contents
A request to collect information about a painting comes from an aristocratic woman in Senshu. I would like to show my paintings of music and flowers to a young lady who loves drawing.

If you're not confident in your discernment, it might be a good idea to ask a scholar in Hangzhou for recommendations.
