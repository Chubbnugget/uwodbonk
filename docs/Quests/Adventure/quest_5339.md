| **Quest Name** | swaying Uranus |

### Quest Contents
A request has come from Mr. Kepler in Frankfurt. Do you know about the planet Uranus? It seems that its trajectory is slightly different from what was predicted. I thought this guy would be perfect for you since you are well versed in astronomy. First, meet the person himself and listen to his detailed story.
