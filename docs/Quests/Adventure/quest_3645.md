| **Quest Name** | Mountain Wall Painting |  

### Quest Contents
I believe you were the one who discovered the rock with African pictures on it, right? Apparently there are quite a few like that all over the world. Was it a play by the ancients, or was it used to communicate? So, this is a request from a scholar, and he wants me to find out if nomads had a similar culture.
