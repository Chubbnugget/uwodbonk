| **Quest Name** | statue of the sun god |  

### Quest Contents
I heard that a statue of Apollo, the sun god in Greek mythology, was seen near Athens. I heard this again from a sailor. Just because it's in the suburbs doesn't mean it's a big deal, right? Wouldn't it be a good idea to get some information from the Athenian scholars first?
