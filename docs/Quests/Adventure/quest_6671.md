### Quest Contents
Hey, did you hear that? It seems that a dangerous creature has recently appeared on the ocean near Manila. For navigators, this is a matter that cannot be ignored. It seems like there's a rumor going around at local bars, so there might be someone out there who knows more about the situation. First of all, please go and collect information. Thank you.
