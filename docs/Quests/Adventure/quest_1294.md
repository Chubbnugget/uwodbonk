### Quest Contents
A sailor returning from Yardein said he saw a strange creature on the outskirts of town. It's a fish-like creature whose entire body is covered in scales, but it seems that the place where it was seen was not near water. Also, it seems like he was digging a hole at an incredible speed... Does such a creature exist? Please try investigating in Yardein first.
