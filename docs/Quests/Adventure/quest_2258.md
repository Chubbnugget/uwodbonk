### Quest Contents
You seem to have done some research on giant tortoises. In fact, a sailor from Copiapo wants to give away a giant tortoise. Giant tortoises eat a lot of everything, so it seems like they had trouble procuring food... He said he would give it to someone who could prepare 200 bags of cacti. If you want to keep one, go for it.
