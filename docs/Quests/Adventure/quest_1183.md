### Quest Contents
There were countless fleets that went to explore the new continent, but only a handful of them were able to set foot on their homeland safely. However, it seems that Cortez's fleet recently discovered a shipwrecked Spanish man there. I would like you to look into that. Mr. Las Casas, who accompanied Cortes, may know something.
