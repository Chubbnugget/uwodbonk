### Details of Quest [Food base supporting Edo]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | The food base that supported Edo |

### Quest Contents
An Edo government official has requested a survey of nearby fisheries for town planning purposes. I guess the aim is to develop the infrastructure that supports the people's dietary habits. Sakai is now the key point for logistics in that region. If you ask around the port first, you'll probably get some useful information.
