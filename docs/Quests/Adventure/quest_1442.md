### Quest Contents
I heard about it from a request broker in Jakarta. I heard you investigated a creature with a pouch in its belly. You could put a child in there and glide through the trees. The guild in this city also received information about a creature with a pouch on its belly. Please do some research. Ask Guildmaster for information about that creature.
