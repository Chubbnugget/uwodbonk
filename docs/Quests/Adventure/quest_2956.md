### Quest Contents
A sailor who was staying in Portobello looked pale and asked me if I would listen to him. Apparently, he saw a beast with an incredibly large fang on the outskirts of Portobello. But it seems like it suddenly disappeared... Lately, I've been dreaming about it. Check out Portobello to see if it's a hallucination or real.
