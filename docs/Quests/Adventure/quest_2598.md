| **Quest Name** | A picture of the Buddhist world |

### Quest Contents
I've been getting some interesting requests. Apparently, a trainee monk wants to see the world of Buddha. As he studied Buddhism, he started wanting to see it with his own eyes. Hey, if you have your intuition, you can find something good, right? First, go to Sakai to listen to what scholars have to say.
