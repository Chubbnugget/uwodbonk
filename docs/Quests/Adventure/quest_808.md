# Quest [Middle of the Ocean]


### Quest [Middle of the Ocean] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Middle of the Ocean |  

### Quest Contents
Apparently there are islands scattered quite a bit due south of Goa. It is a remote location that is difficult to investigate. This time, I wanted them to search locally for any islands that could be used as supply ports when crossing the Indian Ocean. Gather information in Goa and then head there.
