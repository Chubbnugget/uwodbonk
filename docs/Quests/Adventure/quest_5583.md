### Details of the quest [Mountains running through North America]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Mountain range that runs through the North American continent |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from the manager of a certain railway company. It seems that they want me to compile and report information about the huge mountain range that runs through this continent from north to south. I wonder if it will be used as a reference for expanding the railway network. I think it would be a good idea to have a quick chat with the port official in this town and then investigate on the spot.
