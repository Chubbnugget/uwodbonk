### Quest Contents
Do you know about Alexander the Great, who conquered many countries with unstoppable force? The Great King suddenly passed away on his way back from an expedition to the east. I've received a request from a certain scholar to investigate the succession dispute after the Great King's death. Someone in Holmes must have known about the Great King.
