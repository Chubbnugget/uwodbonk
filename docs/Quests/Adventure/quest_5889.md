| **Quest Name** | Beware of deadly poisons |  

### Quest Contents
Do you know anything about poison? No, it was a request from an archaeologist in this city. It seems that he often travels to the countryside, and he would like me to find out about the poisonous plants and animals that I should be careful of when I go there. It is rumored that there is a poison that can even kill humans. A Seville scholar would know something.
