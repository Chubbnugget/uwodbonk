### Details of the quest [Talking not only about the ruins]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | It's not just the ruins that we talk about. |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever been to Crete? Apparently a trader is going there on business and wants to know if there's anything other than ancient ruins that might be related to the island's history. I'm sure the local residents are well aware of this, so could you gather some information in Candia?
