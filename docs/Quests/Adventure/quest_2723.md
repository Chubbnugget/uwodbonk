### Quest Contents
A request to investigate a mysterious flying object! ...I'd like to say that, but according to the client, it looks like a bat. Unfortunately, that bat was apparently made of gold, which is unusual. Have you ever seen a bat? I'm not. So, my client, a sailor, is waiting for me at a bar in Hanyang.
