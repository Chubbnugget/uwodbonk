### Quest Contents
This is a bit of a strange request. It is said that there is a creature that glides between the trees on the southeastern continent, and those who saw it said that it had a small face on its belly. This time I would like you to investigate that creature. There are witnesses in Kakadu. Please check with the port official for routes to Kakadu.
