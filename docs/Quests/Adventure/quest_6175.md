| **Quest Name** | A city connected to the underworld |

### Quest Contents
You previously discovered the remains of a mass grave in Egypt. There are large-scale ruins similar to those in Turkey, and we have received requests to investigate them. There are probably people in Salonica who know more about it, so it might be a good idea to find them and listen to their stories.
