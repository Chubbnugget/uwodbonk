# Quest [Brave Sigurd]

### Quest [Brave Sigurd] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Brave Sigurd |

### Quest Contents
I see, so the ring passed from the creator, Alberich, to the gods, and then to the giants. Don't even think about Odin using a human just before the contract, saying he can't get the ring back himself. So, what happened to Sigurd of Denmark?
