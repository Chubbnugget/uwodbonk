### Quest Contents
It seems you've been to waters north of the Caribbean. That's a quick story then. This is a request from the Adventurer's Guild, but they would like you to investigate whether there are any difficult spots for navigation along the coast north of the Caribbean. If there are any particularly dangerous straits, please let us know. Santo Domingo is close to the site, so I'll ask you to gather information there.
