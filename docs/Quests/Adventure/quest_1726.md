### Quest Contents
Earlier, you would have looked into the Javanese musical instrument called Gundel. Apparently, a certain nobleman read your report and became interested in the shadow play called wayang kulit. I'm going to do some additional research, but can I ask you to do it? You should ask the city officials in Surabaya.
