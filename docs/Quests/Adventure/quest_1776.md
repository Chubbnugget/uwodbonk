The narrowest point is only 64 km from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Although it is far enough to construct a canal, it is mountainous, receives a lot of rainfall, and is covered in dense forest. Additionally, the area is prone to diseases that cause high fevers, so construction will not be easy.
