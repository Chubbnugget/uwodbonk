| **Quest Name** | Looking for the missing black |

### Quest Contents
Do you have a favorite color? I'm sure you have various preferences, but I've been receiving some strange requests. ``I want you to find something that fills my darkness.'' Honestly, I don't want to get involved, but this is also a request. Please hear from my client, a young painter from this city.
