### Quest Contents
Josee has sent a request to the guild, if you don't mind, would you be able to do it? They wanted to ask me to procure materials for the ship, so I had to pay a huge amount of money in advance. If you ask me, it looks like he's having a hard time too, so I wonder what he's going to do with all this money... Go to Sagres and talk to me directly.
