| **Quest Name** | a hanging bell |

### Quest Contents
Have you been to a Japanese temple yet? I think there were quite a few places where bells were caught, but for some reason it seems like there are some temples where you can't catch them even if you wanted to. This is a request from a merchant who wants to know the reason. ...No way...are you trying to sell me a bell? For now, try gathering information around Nagasaki.
