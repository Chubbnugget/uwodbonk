| **Quest Name** | Horse-like Bird |

### Quest Contents
There are some really big birds in Africa, and of course their feathers are huge, so they are often used as feather ornaments. However, I don't really know what kind of ecology this bird is. It is said to run at the speed of a horse. Could you please check something out? Try gathering information at the Sofala rest area.
