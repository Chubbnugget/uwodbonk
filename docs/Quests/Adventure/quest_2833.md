| **Quest Name** | Taikobo Fishing |

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain fisherman. It seems that there is an old tale like this that has been passed down from the Ming Dynasty. When Taikobo went fishing, the fish would come of their own accord, even though the hook was straight, there was no bait, and the hook was above the water surface. ...If I were a fisherman, this would be a story I wouldn't want to ignore. There may be information about Hangzhou.
