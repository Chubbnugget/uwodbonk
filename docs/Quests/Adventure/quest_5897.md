| **Quest Name** | World's Deadly Poison |

### Quest Contents
You have another request from an archaeologist. They told me that they were too scared to investigate if there were still highly poisonous plants like the ones from last time, so they would like me to investigate further. I understand how you feel, but are there any plants out there that are that poisonous? I'm sorry, but please ask the Seville scholar again.
