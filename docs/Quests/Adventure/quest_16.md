| **Quest Name** | Hunting life in Anatolia |

### Quest Contents
Recently, research into the ancient civilization that existed on the Anatolian Peninsula has been progressing. I've been getting a lot of requests from scholars to excavate relics. How about you too? This time, we are conducting excavation work near Cappadocia. It may be difficult for an amateur, but an adventurer like you will have intuition. Try talking to a scholar first.

Anatolian Plateau, deep in the northern coast of Turkey, 5m west of the pointy rock in the northwest, around 308m south Search *As the word "308m" indicates, its effectiveness as a landmark is a mystery. *In short, it's almost directly below the landmark, slightly above the bottom of the "Sun" shape on the left side of the map. *Therefore, it is recommended to go directly to the site without taking a detour (no need to go around).
