### Details of the quest [New flow of religious paintings]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | A new trend in religious painting |  

### Quest Contents
It seems that a unique technique is used for paintings in the Netherlands, and I've received a request to investigate it. Look up a painter named Frans Floris. When he paints religious paintings, he tries to express them with symbolic scenes instead of using the usual drawing methods. Just ask the workshop craftsmen in Antwerp.
