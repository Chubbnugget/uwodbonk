| **Quest Name** | Pergamon's Memento |  

### Quest Contents
It seems that an old record has come out of a scholar's archive. It seems to be a story about the treasure of the Kingdom of Pergamon, which was founded in the Anatolian Peninsula, but I can't get the details. I've been waiting for a long time, thinking that a talented navigator like you might be able to solve this mystery. Go to the scholar right away.

| **Discovery** | [Artwork] (ref_3.md) / [Dying Gaulish] (quest_625.md) A replica of a bronze statue said to have been made by King Attalus I of the Kingdom of Pergamon. Although it is an imitation, it is very well made. It perfectly depicts the complex expressions on the faces of the Galatians, who often invaded the Kingdom of Pergamon, when they faced death.
