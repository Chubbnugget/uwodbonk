### Quest [Belial's Jewel] Details

| **Quest Name** | Belial's Jewel |

### Quest Contents
I've received a somewhat suspicious request... Apparently there is a gem about King Solomon in the European Bible. It seems like there are amulets related to myths in every region, but it's kind of weird. The client is a bar master. If you're interested, go check it out.

It is said that Belial is sealed in this gem. The degree of authenticity is unknown. If you look closely, you can see that the jewel is scratched and has the words ``North Town of Matsunoshima'' engraved on it.
