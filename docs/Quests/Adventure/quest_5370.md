# Quest [Beginning of the Roman Republic]

### Quest [Beginning of the Roman Republic] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Beginning of the Roman Republic |

### Quest Contents
Did you know that Rome was a republic before it became an empire? Did you know that before the republic there was a monarchy? It seems that there is a temple that was built around the time when Rome changed from a monarchy to a republic. I've been asked to find out what kind of temple it was. It would be a good idea to ask the scholars of Seville about these things.
