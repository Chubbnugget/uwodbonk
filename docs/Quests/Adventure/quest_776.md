| **Quest Name** | A huge fish as big as a boat |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever seen a big fish in the sea? Marlin is a surprisingly large fish, but it still only weighs around 100 or 200 kg at most. However, I heard that someone saw a fish the size of a boat in the South Atlantic. No one believes me. Could you please check some bars around Luanda?
