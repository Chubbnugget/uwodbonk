### Quest Contents
Could you please listen to a request from the guild? The Tang Sancai you found the other day. There was a strange man in Hangzhou who kept asking people about the images of women in the books and then carefully read the books he brought with him. I'd like to request an investigation into that man... If you are interested, please talk to the adventurer request intermediary in Hangzhou.
