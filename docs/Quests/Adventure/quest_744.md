### Quest Contents
As you probably know, ``Chronicles'' are books compiled by year. There are things like that in paintings too, and there are people who are looking for that one piece. What I'm looking for is one of Saint Etienne's six-disc set depicting scenes from Jerusalem. Well, just ask the workshop craftsmen in Venice.
