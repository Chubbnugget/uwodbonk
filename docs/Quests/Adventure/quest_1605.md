### Quest Contents
This was a request from a certain dilettante. Noting that India is the birthplace of Buddhism, he asked me to find out what the oldest Buddhist statues looked like. It is true that Buddhism originated here, but I wonder if there are also Buddhist statues here. I wonder if it still exists... First, ask the scholars in this town.
