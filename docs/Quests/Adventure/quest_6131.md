### Quest Contents
Portugal was a country that focused on long-distance navigation from an early age, and it seems that the invasion of Ceuta was the trigger for this. My request is to find out about the situation in Portugal at the time of the Battle of Ceuta and about the prince at the time. Gather information in Lisbon.
