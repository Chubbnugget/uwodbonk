### Quest Contents
A young man studying religious studies wants me to research a famous Taoist mountain in the southern China region. It seems like they want to know what kind of place it is and where it is, but I wonder if it's a famous Taoist mountain? There are many missionaries in Macau. Maybe I can get some information from religious connections.
