| **Quest Name** | Beautiful flowers and their anecdotes |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a gardener. Apparently there is a beautiful flower that was popular in the Ottoman Turkish court. They want to make it popular here in Amsterdam, so they want people to find it. If you have a related anecdote, it will be useful for sales, so I would like you to look it up. You should ask a scholar in Istanbul.
