### Quest Contents
An important person living in Sakai sent a request form to the guild. It seems that an adventurer with a good eye for aesthetics has a favor to ask, but it doesn't seem like the story is about finding works of art. Well, if you visit the owner of a tool shop in Sakai, you'll probably find out more details.
