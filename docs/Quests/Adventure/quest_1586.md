### Quest Contents
You were the one who investigated the Kimberley Plateau. It seems that there is a sacred place called Bungle Bungle deep inside the plateau, but I have received information that there is also another sacred place. It is said to be a place worthy of being called a sacred place, with its terrifyingly gigantic rocks. First, please interview me in Kakadu.
