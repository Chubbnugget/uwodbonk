### Quest Contents
I've heard rumors that you did some monster research near a town called Syracuse. This time I'm asked to investigate a monster called the Kraken, but would you like to try it? The client is the Adventurer's Guild. Please use your skills to uncover the monster's true identity. You should try gathering information in this town first.
