### Quest Contents
Hey, you. Did you know there is a big lake near St. Petersburg? I received a request from a fisherman who wanted me to investigate the lake. When a fisherman requests a lake survey, is it really for fishing purposes? In any case, it's best to ask the residents of the city about this kind of thing.
