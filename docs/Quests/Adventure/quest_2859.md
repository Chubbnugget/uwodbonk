### Quest Contents
I've received a very difficult request! Mushrooms were burning in the mountains near Chongqing! Was it a forest fire? Oh no! Apparently that mushroom was the only one that was burning on its own! Anyway, I heard a story from a Chongqing resident! I don't want to hear a detailed story, so I'm curious!
