You investigated Rhodes Island before, right? The island of Rhodes is said to be home to a colossal statue of Helios, the sun god in Greek mythology. I've received a request to conduct a detailed investigation of Rhodes Island, which is currently thriving as a town. If you're from Athens, which is close to Rhodes, you might know something.
