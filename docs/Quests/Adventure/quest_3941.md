# Quest [Legendary Bard]

### Quest [Legendary Bard] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Legendary Bard |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from Mr. Gesualdo, a musician from Naples. He wants me to find out about the legendary bard and his instrument. Even if someone says he's a legendary minstrel, you probably won't know who he is, so if you're going to accept him, I think it would be best to ask Gesualdo directly.
