| **Quest Name** | new continent bird constellation |

### Quest Contents
You reported on the toucan before, right? Actually, I heard from a navigator that a constellation was created with that bird as a motif. I would like to see it with my own eyes, but I have no idea where to look. I'm sure the voyager stopped by a bar, so please listen to his story.

| **Discovery** | [Astronomy](Categories/category_18.md) / [Kyoshicho constellation](Quests/Trade/quest_3128.md) One of the constellations in the southern sky. It was established in the 16th century. The original giant-beaked bird is thought to be a member of the toucan family, but there seem to be multiple theories about the bird that served as the motif, perhaps because multiple people were involved in creating the design.
