### Quest Contents
I've received an investigation request from a scholar who has started researching the Inca Empire. This time, they want me to do some research on the royal family of the empire. Since this is a completely unknown civilization to us, there may be some surprising customs. They want us to work with an adventurer staying in Lima to conduct an investigation.

Therefore, it seems that there were few rebellions against the king in the Inca Empire. It is said that the mummy was clothed, fed, and interacted with the mummies of other kings, just as she had been when she was alive.
