| **Quest Name** | Extremely Luxurious Tomb |  

### Quest Contents
Big people want to make their graves extravagant. Thanks to this, the grave robbers can't get enough. The Pyramids of Giza are famous, but Chinese food is no less big in scale. I wonder if a large amount of grave goods have been unearthed in that area as well? I wonder about the area around Mt. Undai.
