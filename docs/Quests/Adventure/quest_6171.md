### Quest Contents
Apparently there was an investigation into the ruins of a temple on the opposite bank from Cairo recently. It seems that a large amount of ``certain things'' were found at that time, but I would like to investigate further, so I am requesting your cooperation. Gather detailed information on Cairo and Alexandria.
