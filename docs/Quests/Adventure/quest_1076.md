### Quest Contents
You looked up Rubens' paintings before. In fact, there is a painting that he drew in a different way than he ordered. He's said to be sociable, so I thought he wouldn't be too self-centered, but he's actually an artist. Moreover, the reputation of the picture seems to be very good. Please talk to me first.
