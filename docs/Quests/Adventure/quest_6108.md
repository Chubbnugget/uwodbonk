# Quest [Doubt]


### Quest [Doubt] Details

| **Quest Name** | Doubt |  

### Quest Contents
Hey, how's Jose doing? I haven't heard any rumors lately, but I wonder if he's doing as well as ever. A while ago, a man left a message for you saying, ``I'll be waiting for you at a bar in Lisbon,'' and I think he and Jose had hung out before. Maybe he wants to hear about Jose's current situation.
