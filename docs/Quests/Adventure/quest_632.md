| **Quest Name** | Utopia that actually existed |  

### Quest Contents
I have an interesting story. It is said that a long time ago, a utopia existed in this world. Do you think it really happened? It doesn't matter what you do, it would be a big deal if you could prove its existence. Please check it out. A Venetian scholar might know something.
