### Details of the quest [Shrubs with many medicinal properties]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Shrubs with many medicinal properties |

### Quest Contents
A request from a certain doctor. Apparently there's a shrub south of here that has medicinal properties in both its leaves and flower nectar, so I'd like you to check it out. From what I've heard from voyagers who have visited Kakadu, I think it would be a good idea to gather information there first.
