| **Quest Name** | Giant Green Fish |

### Quest Contents
A huge, creepy green fish has apparently been spotted in the Caribbean Sea. I would like to request an investigation into that person from the guild, would you be willing to accept it? I'm asking this because you've discovered a creepy fish. I can't talk to other people because I'm too scared... If you don't mind, try gathering information in Havana.
