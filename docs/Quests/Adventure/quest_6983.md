| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Survey of Greek goddess statues |  

### Quest Contents
I heard you looked into a sculpture depicting the Roman goddess of justice some time ago. An important person in this town has heard about this and has asked me to find out about a goddess in Greek mythology who is equated with the goddess Eustitia. I think you should ask a scholar about this first.
