### Quest Contents
Do you know the play "Hamlet"? This was a request from a lady who saw that. In the play, the previous king is killed by having Hebona's poison put into his ear canal, but he wants us to find out if such poison really exists. It would be a good idea to ask the author Shakespeare directly in London.
