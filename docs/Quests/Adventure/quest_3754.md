| **Quest Name** | Giant Crab Palace investigation |  

### Quest Contents
Also, this is a request from an aspiring astrologer. Next time, I want you to research the origin of Cancer, one of the zodiac constellations, and actually find it in the night sky. The origin of Cancer... I like eating crabs, but I don't feel like researching them. Would you like to hear from Lisbon's apprentice fishermen?
