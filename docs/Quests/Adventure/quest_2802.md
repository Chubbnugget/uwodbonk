# Quest [Bearded Face]

### Quest [Bearded Face] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Bearded Face |

### Quest Contents
I've received an investigation request from a guild in Hangzhou. A creature with a face covered in whiskers was spotted in the suburbs of Chongqing, and I'm collecting details. There seems to be a lot of information out there, such as walking hunched over, climbing trees, swimming, etc. For now, just ask the Chongqing officials.
