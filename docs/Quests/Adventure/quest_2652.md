### Quest Contents
It seems that a nobleman whose hobby is hunting is looking for a new hunting dog. Apparently, if you were going to get a new one, it would be better if it was rare, so they asked you to do so. It would be great if there was something in Korea that could match the aristocratic eyeglasses... Shall we talk at a bar in Hanyang first?
