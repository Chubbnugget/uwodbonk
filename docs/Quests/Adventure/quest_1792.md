| **Quest Name** | Relationship between desert and sea |  

### Quest Contents
It's a request from a port official in Lima. This is a survey about the weather around Lima. Deserts are associated with heavy showers, but that doesn't seem to be the case around here. They thought it would be easier to research things like that in Europe, so the request came to us. Talk to a Lisbon scholar.
