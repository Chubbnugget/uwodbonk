| **Quest Name** | Friend of the Beast |

### Quest Contents
When livestock such as cows and horses find insects around them, they use their tails to chase them away. However, in Africa there are small birds that cannot be chased away even if they land on the head or body of an animal. A certain scholar has asked me to find out why the small bird is not chased away by animals. Try gathering information on Sofala.
