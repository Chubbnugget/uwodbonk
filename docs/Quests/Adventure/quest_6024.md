### Quest Contents
You were the one who discovered Burgess Shale earlier. Rumor has it that a stone with an extremely strange pattern was found there. It's already a place where you can find a lot of strange stones, but the guild is also paying attention to what is so special about it. Can you check it out in San Francisco?
