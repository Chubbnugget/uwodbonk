### Quest [Proof of Prosperity] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Proof of Prosperity |

### Quest Contents
A long time ago, the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, which conquered this area, had a very wide territory. It seems that they controlled everything from northwestern India to Egypt... It was a request to find some records about the territory. I'm sure there's someone around Basra who knows something.
