| **Quest Name** | Mysterious Ancient God |

### Quest Contents
Since you have a deep knowledge of the Aztec gods, I have a job for you that I would like to ask you to do. On the land you can land on northwest of Veracruz, there is a building with reliefs carved all over it. I would like you to find out about the god depicted on the relief. It would be a good idea to search for information in Veracruz first.
