### Quest Contents
You previously found the travelogue of the Tang monk Xuanzang, right? An additional research request came from the scholar from Calicut, who was my client at that time. In addition to Xuanzang, there are other Tang Dynasty monks who aimed for Tianjiku and brought back sutras and sariras. To find out, it would be best to first listen to a scholar in Hangzhou.
