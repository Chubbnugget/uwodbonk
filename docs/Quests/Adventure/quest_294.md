### Details of the quest [Folktales of Malaga]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Malaga folklore |  

### Quest Contents
Hear the history of the city of Malaga from its residents. This was a request from someone who was trying to start a new business over there. It hasn't been long since that port belonged to Spain. That's why there are so many things I don't understand. I hope I can hear at least one of the old stories.
