### Quest Contents
It was a painstaking effort to confirm and survey the shipping routes of the archipelago east of Malacca. It seems like you can navigate any complicated route. As for my request, I was told that to the east of Surabaya there is a sea area that is densely populated with islands. Confirm and investigate the shipping route in that area. Don't forget to gather information in Surabaya.
