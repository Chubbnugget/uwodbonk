### Quest Contents
I heard that there is a deer on the island of Taiwan that is nicknamed the "four-eyed deer." Do you know that? Sailors from this town heard about it when they stopped by Taiwan Island. However, it seems that they were not able to see the real thing and are concerned about it. Please ask the person for details and try to find it.
