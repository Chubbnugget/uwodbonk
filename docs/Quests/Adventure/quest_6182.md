### Quest Contents
Have you ever found a papyrus written in a script other than Ancient Egyptian? I would like to ask you to take that into account. It seems that another voyager recently found a Hebrew papyrus in a market in Cairo, for some reason. I would like you to look into the details in Cairo.
