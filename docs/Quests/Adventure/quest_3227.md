### Quest Contents
You have a request from a girl named Olga. I guess you were indebted to the Vikings on their voyage the other day, and you said you had a younger brother who couldn't return home. Did you meet him in the "Land of Grapes"? ...By the way, I wonder who the folklorist who was asking about the Vikings was?
