### Quest Contents
The Yoruba people are the most common in this area, but there are many other ethnic groups as well. However, I don't know much about nomadic tribes. This time, I would like you to look into the myth of the Nupe, one of these nomadic tribes. There may be someone in this town who knows the details. Just ask at the bar.
