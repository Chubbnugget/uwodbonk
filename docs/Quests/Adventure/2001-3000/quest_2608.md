### Quest Contents
Once again, I heard from a certain tute that he saw a strange ship in Lanyu. This time as well, the guild is gathering information about what that ship is, but it's having a difficult time. I'm going to ask you to go to Anping and gather information. I'm confident that you'll be able to pin it down again.
