| **Quest Name** | The threat of poisonous snakes |

### Quest Contents
I received a request from a town official in Anping. It seems that residents who go to work in the mountains are attacked by snakes from the tops of trees. It's also highly poisonous, and they're currently thinking of ways to deal with the snake. I went to ask the client about the details of the request.
