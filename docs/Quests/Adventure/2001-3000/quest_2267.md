### Quest Contents
Thank you for your hard work investigating Pohnpei Island. There was a report that stones were being piled up, and a scholar has requested that we investigate this matter in detail. If I remember correctly, I heard about the island from the owner of a rest stop in Guam. I don't know anything about this stone.
