### Quest Contents
You were the one who discovered the Sangokushiki, weren't you? A historian is looking for new materials. Isn't there a bias in the period in which the history of the Three Kingdoms was written? It seems like they would like me to look into any documents that describe other eras. Please consult the scholars in Hanyang again.
