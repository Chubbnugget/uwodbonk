| **Quest Name** | tree that protects ships |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a painter in this town. They told me that there was a plant on the other side of the eastern sea that could protect ships, and that they wanted me to research it. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of voyagers coming and going in this area, so they want to use it as a reference for painting new ships. Speaking of east, it's the direction of your hometown, right? Let's listen to the story
