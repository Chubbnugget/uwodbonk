| **Quest Name** | Inca stone wall |

### Quest Contents
The guild has sent you a request to investigate the Inca Empire. As you probably know from visiting the country, that country has a culture that we cannot even imagine. I'd like you to clarify this, even if it's just a little at a time. First, please listen to the story from the adventurer who will be waiting until the end.
