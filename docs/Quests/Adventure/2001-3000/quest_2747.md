### Quest Contents
You were the one who reported about Anken's painting, right? The art dealer at the time asked me again, would you accept it? It seems like they want to see the paintings by the painters who were influenced by Anken, which was mentioned in the report. Could you please consult with the Hanyang scholar again?
