### Quest Contents
It's a request from the son of a certain nobleman. It seems like he's interested in adventure and exploration. Apparently, he wants to see not only adventure stories, but also things related to them. Well, I think it's okay to tell your own adventure stories, but I'd like to ask a famous explorer about this.
