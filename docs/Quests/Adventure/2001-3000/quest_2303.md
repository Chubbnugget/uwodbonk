| **Quest Name** | Tika and Land Iguana |

### Quest Contents
Do you know anything about land iguanas? In that case, I would like you to consult with Tika. I'm usually absent-minded, but lately I haven't had much energy. When the concerned townspeople asked the master, it seemed that he was hurting about the iguana. Please listen to Tika's story.
