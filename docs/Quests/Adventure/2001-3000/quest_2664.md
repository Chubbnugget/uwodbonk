### Quest Contents
Of course you know about Yongxi of Hanyang, right? There's a rumor that that good-natured girl is actually good at dancing. Sorry, but I've never seen you dance. Of course I'll give you a reward, but why don't you ask me what kind of dance it is? I'm very busy mediating the request.
