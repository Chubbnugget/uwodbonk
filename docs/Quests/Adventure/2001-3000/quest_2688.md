# Quest [Gaya's Record]

### Quest [Gaya's Record] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Gaya's Record |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a scholar who is researching the history of Silla. I heard that there was a mention of ``Gaya'' in a certain document. I'm guessing that it's probably a place name from back then, but I can't seem to find any evidence to prove it. If it's in the Hanyang archives, there might be books about it. It's also good to talk to scholars.
