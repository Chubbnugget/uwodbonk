### Details of the quest [Truth or falsity of the insect story]

| **Quest Name** | The truth about insects |

### Quest Contents
I don't know what the circumstances were, but an old sailor came to the guild crying. I want you to confirm that the story I heard about insects from an acquaintance is a lie. It seems like a big deal for him personally. If you are a client, please come to Sakai.
