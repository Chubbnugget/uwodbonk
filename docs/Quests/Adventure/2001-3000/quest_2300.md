# Quest [Slope in the plaza]

### Quest [Slope in the plaza] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Slope in the plaza |

### Quest Contents
You've successfully discovered the ruins of the Copan River, and a scholar has asked you for additional research. It seems that the scholar is also investigating the ruins, but has come to a dead end. I was puzzled as to why the slopes spread across the flat land. It would be quicker to ask the local people about this.
