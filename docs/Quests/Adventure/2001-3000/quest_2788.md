| **Quest Name** | Great Buddha of South China |

### Quest Contents
It seems that the people at the temple heard from a monk who went to South China that the people there believe in Buddhism and there are many large Buddha statues there. I have received a request to come and inspect the impressive Great Buddha in order to visit it. A monk who went to South China said that a young man in Quanzhou had told him about the Great Buddha.
