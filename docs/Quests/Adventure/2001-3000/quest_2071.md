### Quest [Long-tailed Shark] Details

| **Quest Name** | Long-tailed Shark |

### Quest Contents
I heard from a sailor who came back from a voyage that he saw a shark with a very long tail in the southern seas. I've never heard of a shark with an extremely long tail. I'm sorry, but I'd like you to do some research on this shark. Listen to the details from the sailor at the bar, then head out to investigate.
