### Quest Contents
You're a navigator who came to this town in search of Quagga. A quagga is an animal that is half horse and half zebra, but the animal requested this time is a combination of a deer, a cow, a horse, and a donkey. It's like a child's fantasy, right? If you are interested, please hear from my client Arides.
