### Quest Contents
A scholar from this city is calling you right away. After hearing the story about the Great Tang Dynasty Records, he seemed to be very interested in the person named Taizong of the Tang Dynasty. It seems like they're doing some research. I think the request is for research cooperation, but just to be sure, go to the scholar and ask.
