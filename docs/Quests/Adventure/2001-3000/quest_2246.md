| **Quest Name** | Red-faced Lizard |

### Quest Contents
This is a request from me, but I would like you to investigate a certain lizard. Did you see the red-faced lizard when you discovered the land iguana? Apparently, a young man living in Panama is telling his friends that he saw a small lizard with a bright red face. It was my first time hearing about it, so I was a little curious.
