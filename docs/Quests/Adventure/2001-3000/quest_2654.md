# Quest [Butterfly with a Tail]

### Quest [Butterfly with a Tail] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Butterfly with a Tail |

### Quest Contents
This was requested by a scholar who had just gone to Korea. I saw a butterfly that I had never seen before, so I wanted to ask them to investigate. Its distinctive feature is that it has tails on its wings, which allow it to fly slowly. It seems that I was so fascinated by it that I failed to catch it. If you were a Hanyang scholar, you would know about that butterfly.
