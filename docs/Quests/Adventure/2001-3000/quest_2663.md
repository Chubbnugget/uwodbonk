### Quest Contents
Have you ever been to the suburbs of Pohang? Actually, there's a problem with thieves infesting that area. I unearthed a blue-colored treasure, only to have it stolen... So, you, who are very skilled, receive a request to exterminate the bandits and investigate that place. If you accept it, I'd say go ask the scholars in Hanyang for details.
