| **Quest Name** | water falling from a great height |

### Quest Contents
It seems you have experience investigating waterfalls. I have a job that I would like to ask you to do. Apparently, a scholar from your hometown has requested a geographical survey because there is a place across the western sea where water flows down from a tremendous height. If you accept it, please check it out in Cayenne.
