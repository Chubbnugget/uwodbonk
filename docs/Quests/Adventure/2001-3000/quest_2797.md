### Details of the quest [Taijo Elder]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Taishang Laojun |

### Quest Contents
After receiving the research report on Mt. Samcheong, we have received another request from a young man studying religious studies. He seems to want to know the details about the old man mentioned in the report. Since it is said to be a Taoist god...it would be best to look into it in the southern China region. Also, why not ask the missionaries in Macao?
