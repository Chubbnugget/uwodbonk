| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | In Search of the Right Language |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a European translator. Apparently there was an error in the language dictionary for the Korean Peninsula, and they were at a loss. I could ask someone who is fluent in the Korean language to help me, but I would like to have some materials for the future. Local scholars will be able to help.
