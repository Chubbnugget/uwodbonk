### Details of the quest [Waka collection next to Manyoshu]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | A collection of waka poems next to Manyoshu |

### Quest Contents
After you discover the Manyoshu, you will receive a request from some important person. It seems that he has acquired a collection of waka poems that is second only to the Manyoshu, but he has lost the booklet and would like me to find someone to borrow the manuscript from. This sounds like something rich people are bragging about and it's disgusting. Well, just ask the city officials in Sakai.
