### Details of the quest [Secrets of Warfare]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | The secret of military tactics |

### Quest Contents
I've been receiving requests from the Marseille guild all this way. A military officer said to me, ``I want you to research the secrets of military tactics handed down in the East.'' Are you such a skilled adventurer that you found a book called Romance of the Three Kingdoms in Chongqing?　Does anyone who knows a lot about this kind of thing have any idea?
