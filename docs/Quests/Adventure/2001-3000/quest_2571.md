Did you know that high-quality deerskin is a trade item on Taiwan Island? A nobleman who really liked that deerskin said he wanted the deer itself. Looks like he's planning on keeping a deer. ...I know what you mean, but I'd like you to investigate that deer. Wouldn't it be better to gather information around Anping on Taiwan Island?
