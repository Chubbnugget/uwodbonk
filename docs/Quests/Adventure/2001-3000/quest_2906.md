| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Small animals that appeared in the Yangtze River |

### Quest Contents
A request from the guild. I would like to request an investigation into a small animal that has recently become a hot topic in Hangzhou. Do you know about the Yangtze River that flows near Hangzhou? It seems like I've started seeing small animals at the estuary, so I'm collecting details. Would you like to talk to a scholar in Hangzhou?
