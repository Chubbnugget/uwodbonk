### Quest Contents
An important person in Europe asked me to look for birds. It seems like he wants to add one or two tasteful bird feathers to his hat. If you wear the feathers of a beautiful bird from another country, it will definitely become a hot topic. If you are interested in dating this story, please talk to the Edo port official.
