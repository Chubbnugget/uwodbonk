### Details of the quest [Uncover the unknown identity]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Uncover the unknown |

### Quest Contents
Looks like the investigation into the Catacombs of Lima is progressing. I think it's because I saw you during the investigation, but it seems like Tika has something she would like to discuss with you. I don't know much about it, but apparently he was muttering things like ghosts and food. Well, as always about food, I guess I'm hungry again.
