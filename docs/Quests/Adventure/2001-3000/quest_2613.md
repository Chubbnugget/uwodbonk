### Quest Contents
The Brunei gatekeeper who asked you to investigate Mr. Zheng Chenggong called you. It seems that there is a word that came to mind when looking at the results of the previous survey. It seems like they want you to look into that again. This time as well, the client said he would discuss the details. Do what I'm asked to do.
