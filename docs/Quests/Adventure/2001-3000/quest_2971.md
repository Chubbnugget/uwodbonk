### Quest Contents
Have you ever heard the rumor about the flower of the sun? The guild would want to investigate if it were to be likened to something so large-scale. From what I see, you seem to have a pretty good eye for plants. Will you take on this investigation? For details, please ask the adventurer guild master in this city.
