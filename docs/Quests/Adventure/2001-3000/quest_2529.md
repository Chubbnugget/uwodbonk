### Details of the quest [A roadside tree with a difference]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | A street tree with a difference |

### Quest Contents
At the request of a certain noble, I'm looking for stylish roadside trees in various areas. It seems that "stylish" refers to something a little different, such as blooming beautiful flowers or producing beautiful fruit. If you have plans to go as far as Taiwan Island, would you be willing to accept it? Information will be gathered in Anping.
