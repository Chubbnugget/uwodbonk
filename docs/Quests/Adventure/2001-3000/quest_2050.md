### Quest Contents
Are you the one who researched Khayyam's collection of poems? I have a job that I would like to entrust to you. I want you to look for a book written by a Persian prime minister about imperial studies. There are very few old documents left in Persian, making it difficult to research. For more details, please ask the client, a scholar in this city.
