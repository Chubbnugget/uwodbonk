# Quest [Island and Mountain]

### Quest [Island and Mountain] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Island and Mountain |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a young painter who is trying to bring landscape painting to a new level. He said he was looking for a mountain that would make a good subject. Come to think of it, there's apparently a huge mountain on a small island southeast of Guam. Maybe I can use it. Now, I want you to see it with your own eyes and judge for yourself.
