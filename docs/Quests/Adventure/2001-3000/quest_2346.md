### Quest Contents
This is a request from a merchant staying in Nagasaki. I heard that while I was walking around Japan, I came across a strange place. I'm still curious about this, so I'm asking you to look into it. It seems that the person himself will tell you the details, so please head to Nagasaki right away.
