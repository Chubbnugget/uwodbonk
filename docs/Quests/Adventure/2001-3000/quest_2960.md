### Quest [Northern Penguin] Details

| **Quest Name** | Northern Penguin |

### Quest Contents
There are animals called penguins in the south, right? I've seen him before, and he was quite cute. As for my request, a certain biologist would like me to investigate whether there are penguins in the north. I guess it's a survey of ecological differences due to climate. Shall we try gathering information at a bar in Portobello?
