### Quest Contents
I read the investigation report on the firewalking mikoshi. This time, I would like you to investigate what kind of god the land god who is riding on the mikoshi is. It might be related to another request. This is a direct request from the guild. Thank you for your help! According to the report, it was a trader from Anping who told me the story of Tuo Gong.
