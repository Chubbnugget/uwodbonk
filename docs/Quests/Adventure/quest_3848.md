### Quest Contents
This was a request from a certain European scholar. It seems that the indigenous peoples of the west coast of North America carve splendid carvings on the pillars of buildings and graves. What's more, it's a shame that even when they begin to corrode, they don't reinforce or repair them. Find out the reason behind this in this city.

| **Discovery** | [Historical Relic](Categories/category_7.md) / [Totem Pole](Quests/Adventure/quest_1180.md) A wooden carving made by the indigenous people of the west coast of North America. Animals and people related to the family's history were engraved on them, and they were erected as pillars of houses or on graves. The reason why things are not repaired even if they are damaged and are returned to the earth after rotting is based on their idea that they are born from nature and return to nature.
