| **Quest Name** | Collaboration between different eras |

### Quest Contents
It doesn't necessarily mean that the works of art we have today were in their current form from the beginning, right? It may have been processed into its current form by another person in another era. A scholar has asked me to investigate whether there are any such cases, and I think I might be able to find such a work at a museum in Paris.
