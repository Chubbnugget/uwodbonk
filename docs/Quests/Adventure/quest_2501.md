### Quest Contents
Do you know the indigenous people of Taiwan? It seems that they are an ethnic group that has lived on the island of Taiwan for a long time, but recently they have been living hidden away in the mountains and have little interaction with the city's residents. A scholar from Anping was researching the people. I would like help with research outside of academic fields.
