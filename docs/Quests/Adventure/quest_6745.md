### Details of the quest [Longing for a journey with a hawk]

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Longing for a trip with a hawk |

### Quest Contents
I'm sorry...the princess said she wanted to keep a hawk. The main character of an Eastern novel I read recently seemed to be a falconer, and I think I was influenced by that. I can't refuse a request from the royal family. For now, please go to Macao and interview me at a bar.
