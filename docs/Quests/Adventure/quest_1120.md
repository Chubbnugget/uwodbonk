### Details of the quest [The Curious Jewel of Saint-Georges]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | The strange jewel of Saint-Georges |

### Quest Contents
Jewelry has value, and above all, it attracts people's attention. However, on the other hand, there are also dark stories surrounding jewels and anecdotes that cannot be understood by the human mind. My current request is to find such a unique piece of jewelry. The client is a European aristocrat, so please do your best.
