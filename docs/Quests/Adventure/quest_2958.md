### Quest Contents
You know a girl named Angela who works at a bar in this town, right? The girl has asked me to look for flowers. I heard about a voyageur who came from the south, and he told me that there was a flower that he was interested in. She said something about the gold chain and how it didn't look like a flower... For now, you should go see him.
