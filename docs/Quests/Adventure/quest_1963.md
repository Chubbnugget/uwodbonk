### Quest Contents
A certain source has requested an investigation into the weapons used by the Incas. You've done a lot of requests so far, so you can understand why you can't reveal the client, right? However, the Inca people would be wary of them and would have a hard time hearing what they had to say. Talk to the trading post owner in Lima.
