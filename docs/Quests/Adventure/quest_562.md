### Quest Contents
While turning over old books. There are a lot of legends that come out that seem to be just bullshit. The civilization of Atlantis has long been known. There are various theories, but some say it's the Aegean Sea. Even if it's just a rumor, could you please look into it? It would be a good idea to ask at a bar in Candia.
