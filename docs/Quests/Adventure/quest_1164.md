# Quest [Plant Ship]

### Quest [Plant Ship] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Plant Ship |

### Quest Contents
Apparently there is a fairly large plant near the middle of the Amazon River. Apparently it floats on water and won't sink even if you put a person on it. There may be some interesting uses for it, so I'd like you to investigate it. Ask the sailors in this town for information about the plant.
