| **Quest Name** | rock paintings of sacred places |

### Quest Contents
I have a request for those of you who have seen rock paintings in various places. There is a rocky mountain in southern Africa that is considered a sacred place, and there are apparently paintings drawn on the walls of caves there. Rumor has it that it was painted in ancient times, but please look into it. I think it would be a good idea to start asking questions around Karibib.
