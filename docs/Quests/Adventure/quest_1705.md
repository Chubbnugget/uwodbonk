### Quest Contents
Thanks to you discovering something that looks like the Ark of the Holy Ark, there's a lot of commotion going on everywhere. It would have been nice if they had also found the stone tablets inscribed with Moses' Ten Commandments, just as they were in the Bible. By the way, it seems that the scholar has something to say again. It seems like you want to make a new request.
