| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Life on the southern continent |

### Quest Contents
We've made a lot of progress in researching the southeastern continent, but there's still a lot of plants and animals that we don't know about, and there's still a lack of information when it comes to moving there. Therefore, I would like you to investigate what kind of food the people who have lived there for a long time have been eating and how they live. Can you come to Kakadu?
