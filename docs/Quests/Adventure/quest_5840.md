| **Quest Name** | Japanese picture scrolls |  

### Quest Contents
This was a request from an artist in town. In Japanese picture scrolls, it seems that the same person is depicted many times in one picture. I thought it was just a typo, but apparently there are multiple such paintings. I wonder what it all means...? It's said that an Edo merchant sells picture scrolls, so I'd like you to ask him about it.
