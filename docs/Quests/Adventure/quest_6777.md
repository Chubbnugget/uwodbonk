| **Quest Name** | Giant Sword User |  

### Quest Contents
It seems that there is a swordsman in the East who wields a sword that is over three times his own height. And you're not alone! I had no idea that there were greatsword users outside of Scotland. The people at the historical society seem to be quite interested, too. Could you please go to Nagasaki and investigate this story?
