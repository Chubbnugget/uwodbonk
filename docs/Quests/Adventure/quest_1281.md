### Quest Contents
Do you know Zheng He? He was a military officer from the Ming Dynasty who sailed all the way to Africa. If you're a voyager, you probably know the name, right? I've received a request to find something that Zheng He used on his voyage. Most likely, it will be used for research on navigational technology. Just ask around town.
