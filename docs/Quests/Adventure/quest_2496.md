### Quest Contents
It was a request from an ethnologist from a certain country. I want to know how people live here, but I don't know how to find out. So I want you to find a way to do that. It's a strange feeling to conduct a survey using the survey method. Well, why don't you ask the scholars in this town? I hope I can find some clue.
