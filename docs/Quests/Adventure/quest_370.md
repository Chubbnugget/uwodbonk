### Details of the quest [Picture of fruit basket only]

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | A picture of just a fruit basket |  

### Quest Contents
When we think of paintings, we usually always draw pictures of people. However, apparently there is a painting that depicts only a basket of fruit. It's not a study, but a completed painting. Although it is an unconventional painting, it seems to be a good one, and there are many people who want it, but I don't know where it is. Just ask the Venetian workshop craftsmen.
