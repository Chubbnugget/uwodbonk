# Details of the quest [Platypus Poison]

### Details of the quest [Platypus Poison]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | platypus venom |

### Quest Contents
It seems that the voyager who washed up in Hobart is sick and in bed. Residents who can't help but ask for help. Apparently it was poisoned by an animal, but apparently it was from a platypus. If you've done some research, you're probably the right person. I think everything will be fine as long as I have an antidote, but could you please go with me?
