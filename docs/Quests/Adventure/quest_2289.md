### Details of the quest [Grave goods handed down]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Grave goods handed down |

### Quest Contents
It's a request from the Copan River Ruins Investigation Team. It seems that a large number of stone tools, stick-shaped and with worn sides, were unearthed. The fact that there were so many of them means that they are common tools and may still be used today. If we know the purpose, we may be able to find out the identity of the person buried there. Please try to gather information in Guatemala.
