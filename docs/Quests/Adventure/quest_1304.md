### Quest Contents
This is a request from a resident of Ceylon. When he went to a forest on the outskirts of Brunei, he heard an incredibly loud sound. Is it a bird that makes this sound, or is it some creature that we don't know about? I want you to find out the truth. First, hear from the client.
