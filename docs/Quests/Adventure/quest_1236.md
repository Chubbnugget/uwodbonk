| **Quest Name** | Shrinking Body |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever seen a baby frog? It looks like a black sphere with a long tail attached to it. Normally, your body grows as you grow up from being a child to a parent. But I guess there might be exceptions. For more details, please ask the residents of this town.
