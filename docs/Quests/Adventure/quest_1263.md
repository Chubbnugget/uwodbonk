| **Quest Name** | Restoration work on masterpieces |  

### Quest Contents
It was a request from Michelangelo. The Laocoön statue that I had repaired the other day seems to have to be repaired regularly. It's an important piece of art, so I'll order it without fail. The statue of Laocoon is next to the book stand in a church in Venice. You'll probably need about 5 boxes of marble for restoration. Report to Michelangelo when you're done.
