### Quest [Surface of the Moon] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Surface of the Moon |  

### Quest Contents
It was a request from a scholar in the city of Alexandria. It seems they want you to find out about that moon that rises in the night sky. The symbol of Ottoman Türkiye is the crescent moon, so maybe that has something to do with it. If you're going to accept the request, would you please meet the scholar in Alexandria directly and listen to his story?
