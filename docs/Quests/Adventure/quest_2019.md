| **Quest Name** | South American topographic survey |  

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a map craftsman. Is there a place south of Valparaiso where you can land? It seems that there is a cape further south, and they would like you to investigate it. I heard that you would like to ask an experienced navigator to help you, but of course he will accept the request, right?
