# Quest [Aztecs and Obsidian]

### Quest [Aztecs and Obsidian] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Aztecs and Obsidian |

### Quest Contents
You found the obsidian sword that the Aztecs used in warfare, right? I'm going to do some additional research, but would you mind asking me to do it? Apparently the Aztecs had metal utensils, but they didn't seem to place much importance on them. Find out why in Veracruz.
