A request has come from Raul at the bar. I haven't heard the details of the request since it's going to be a long story, but I was asked to choose a person to take on the job. I can trust you and think you're the right person. For more details, please go to Raul.

| **Discovery** | [Treasure](Categories/category_4.md) / [Flower drunken stone](Quests/Adventure/quest_902.md) A huge fluorite rough stone. It's hard to see something this big. Some fluorite emits light when exposed to sunlight, but it emits light very strongly. It seems that it was given this name because it gives a feeling of mild intoxication to those who see it.
