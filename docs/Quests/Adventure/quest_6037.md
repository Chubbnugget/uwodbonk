| **Quest Name** | Valuable Tea Utensil |

### Quest Contents
Is it true that there were even fights over tea utensils in Japan? Apparently there was even a military commander who didn't want to hand over his tea utensils and destroyed them. It must be a really beautiful thing. I've received a request from an interested nobleman, so could you please do some research in Sakai?
