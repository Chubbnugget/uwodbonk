# Quest [Stacked Brick House]


### Quest [Stacked Brick House] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Stacked Brick House |  

### Quest Contents
This was a request from an architect. Apparently there is a tiered brick village in the central part of the continent east of San Francisco. I'd like to refer to that architectural technique, so can I ask you to do some research? This kind of thing seems like something a scholar would know, so it would be a good idea to ask a local scholar.
