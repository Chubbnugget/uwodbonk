# Quest [Hard Defense]

### Quest [Hard Defense] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Hard Defense |

### Quest Contents
During battle, no matter how powerful the attack your opponent is, if you have armor that can overcome it, you will be able to evade it. Apparently there are creatures that wear such hard armor. Of course, that doesn't mean I'm going to fight. This is an investigation request from a Jamaican workshop craftsman. Please ask the person himself for details.
