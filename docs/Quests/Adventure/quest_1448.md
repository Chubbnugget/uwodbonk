### Quest [Predator with a Bag] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Predator with a Bag |  

### Quest Contents
You've investigated several creatures with pouches so far. I think most of them ate grass and nuts, but this one is different. After all, it's going to prey on the wombat you investigated earlier. This time, I will request an investigation into that creature. First, hear from the Kakadu town officials.
