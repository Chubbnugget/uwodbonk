### Quest Contents
It is said that bones of large animals were found near the Yellow River. However, as the research progresses, there seems to be controversy among scholars. The investigation seems to be going nowhere. It seems like Hangzhou scholars have gathered a lot of people who are good at biology. If you are confident in biology, please visit a scholar and listen to his story.
