A request from a foreign merchant. When I went to Hangzhou for work, I heard a strange bird cry. It was an irregular cry that sounded like it was singing. Find out what kind of bird it is. If you want to know anything about Hangzhou, it's best to ask people in that city. I'm sure the young man from Hangzhou knew a lot about birds.
