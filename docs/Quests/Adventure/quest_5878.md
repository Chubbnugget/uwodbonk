### Quest Contents
Do you know about the Christmas star? It's a star to decorate on the tree. Apparently there is a model star for that thing, but no matter where I look, I can't observe it! There was a man saying that. Well, I guess my observation method is bad. Could you ask me some observation tips from a scholar in this town?
