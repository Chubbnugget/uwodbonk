### Quest Contents
It was a request from a certain nobleman. There is a legend that has existed around here for a long time, but it is said that a queen who once lived in the Bohemia region was in possession of a large emerald. I want you to find out where the emerald is now. Johanna at the bar knows all about that kind of story. You should ask.
