| **Quest Name** | A beautiful voice that resonates in South America |

### Quest Contents
Some time ago, I researched birds with beautiful voices in the Far East, right? Apparently, there is a bird in the south of the New World with a voice as beautiful as that one. It's even been talked about across continents, so I'm a little curious too, so please look into it. It would be a good idea to do some research in Rio de Janeiro first.
