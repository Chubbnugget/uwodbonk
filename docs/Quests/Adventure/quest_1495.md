### Quest Contents
I received a direct request from the Earl of Leicester. He heard about the creatures swimming around in the water that you investigated earlier, and he seemed to be interested. It seems that the Earl of Leicester will discuss the details of the request. Be sure not to be rude in the royal palace.
