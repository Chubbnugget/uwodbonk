### Quest Contents
When I passed through the plaza earlier, I received a request from a seminarian who was there. Apparently there's something they want you to find out about eggs. Eggs are said to be indispensable for any voyage. The client, a seminarian, should be waiting in the plaza. I'll leave the rest to you.
