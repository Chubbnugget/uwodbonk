### Quest Contents
I have a request for you to do. Did you know that there is a continent if you go southeast from this city? Apparently there is a huge bay on the north coast of that continent. I'll ask you to investigate that bay. Also on the north coast of the continent is the city of Kakadu. You can ask about the state of the bay there.
