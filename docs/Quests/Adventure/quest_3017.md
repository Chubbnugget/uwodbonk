### Quest Contents
Have you ever found a throat guard made of shellfish before? There seems to be a strange copper plate depicting a human with wings near the place where it was discovered, and some scholars have asked us to investigate it. Apparently the person who brought the story was a sailor returning from Santo Domingo, so it would be a good idea to ask there.
