How is this Sakai town? Well, it's a question that can't be answered in one word. What I would like to ask you to do this time is such an investigation. The big people who rule this town want to develop it further, so they look into its past and present reputation. I heard you gathered information from various people on your ship. Let's start with Nagasaki.
