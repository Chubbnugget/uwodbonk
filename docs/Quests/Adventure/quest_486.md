| **Quest Name** | Advariu Priest's Scripture |

### Quest Contents
You seem to know a lot about Indian scriptures. I received a request like this, what do you think? It is said that in Hindu festivals, offerings are made to the gods, and I would like you to look into the sacred scriptures that compile the hymns that are chanted during these ceremonies. I wonder if they can tell me something like that. Check it out in Calicut.
