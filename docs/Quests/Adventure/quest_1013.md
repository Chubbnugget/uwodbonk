### Quest Contents
You've probably heard of the Crusades. That was quite a long time ago. Regular crusades were sent eight times, but there were also irregular crusades. All I know is that it was led by a certain monk, but I'd like you to find out more about that crusade. First, ask at a bar in Bordeaux.
