| **Quest Name** | For the groom's appearance |

### Quest Contents
A certain merchant was to marry the daughter of a nobleman. So, it seems that they are looking for a dish that would not be embarrassing to serve at a wedding banquet, but the person in question is a pretentious person and has a hard time finding something that satisfies him. I'm sure there's someone in Oxford who knows a lot about fancy food.
