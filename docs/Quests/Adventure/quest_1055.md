### Details of the quest [Large of megaliths]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | rows of megaliths |

### Quest Contents
Apparently there is a place in the French countryside where large stones are lined up in rows. I don't think I have any idea who did it, when they did it, or why. I think you have an idea, but could you please look into it? Apparently it's near Nantes, so it would be a good idea to check there.
