| **Quest Name** | Colossus of the Sun God |  

### Quest Contents
Do you know Helios, the sun god in Greek mythology? It seems that there is a huge statue of Helios on an island somewhere. I've received a request from a rumor-loving lady in this town to find out where that island is. Since it's Greek mythology, why not ask the port official in Athens?
