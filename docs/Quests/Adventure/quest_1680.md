### Quest Contents
I want you, the one who investigated the insect with the spear, to do this request. From what the bar patrons in this town were talking about, it became possible that there was another insect living there that resembled the spear-wielding insect. I want you to check the truth with your own eyes. First, talk to the sailor at the bar.
