### Quest Contents
I'm sure you understand the dangers of poisonous plants. Actually, this is another request from an archaeologist. Can you understand without me saying it anymore? If you've come this far, it might be a good idea to do some research for your future adventures. If you agree, please visit the scholar in Seville again.
