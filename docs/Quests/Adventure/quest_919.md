| **Quest Name** | Memory of Tragedy |

### Quest Contents
Ancient Greece was not the name of a country, but at that time there were tons of towns. Among them, the Spartan army was the most powerful. I would like you to find out whether it is true that the supposedly strong Spartan army was completely defeated by the Persian army. Of course, an Athenian scholar would know the details.
