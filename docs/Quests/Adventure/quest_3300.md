You were the one who persuaded the Oxford dropout the other time, weren't you? A request came in from a researcher who claimed to be a childhood friend of the student. I want to thank you personally for the terrain called Mesa, so I want you to come see me... He's a polite guy. If you have time, go to Oxford.
