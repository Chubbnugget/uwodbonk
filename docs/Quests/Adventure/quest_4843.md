### Quest Contents
We've received a request from scholars who study constellations to help gather information about a constellation shaped like a bird, Apollo's messenger. He seems to want to know whether the bird's false alarm was a malicious lie or just a simple mistake. The scholars in this town are also helping with research, so come talk to them.
