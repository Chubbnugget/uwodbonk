### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain scholar. There are myths where humans and fairies transform. This time, he wants us to investigate the story of a beautiful girl who was transformed into the form of a beast. There are many stories like this in Greek mythology. I think you should ask the Athenian scholars.
