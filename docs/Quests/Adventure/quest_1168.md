# Quest [Unusual Stone]

### Quest [Unusual Stone] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Unusual Stone |

### Quest Contents
It seems that strangely shaped stone ruins were recently discovered on the outskirts of Veracruz. It's such an unusual shape that I can't imagine what it was used for. For the time being, it seems like we've been told that if we collect the numbers, we might be able to figure out something. Ask Veracruz where the stone is.
