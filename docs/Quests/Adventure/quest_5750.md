# Quest [Land of Seals]

### Quest [Land of Seals] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Land of Seals |

### Quest Contents
If you have something to do to the west, could you please undertake a geographical survey? Apparently there are islands to the southwest of Pinjara where you can see many seals, so I would like you to record their locations and report them. It would be better to get information from Pinjara first.
