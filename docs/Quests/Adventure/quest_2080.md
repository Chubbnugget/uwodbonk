### Details of the quest [Charm of the Poisonous Spider]

| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | The charm of poisonous spiders |  

### Quest Contents
It was a request from a European aristocrat. A certain count seems to have a hobby of keeping spiders. They want us to investigate whether there are any poisonous spiders living in this area. I really don't understand the debauchery of the rich. For now, it would be a good idea to ask some famous explorers about it.
