### Quest Contents
Do you know about the kingdom called Angkor Dynasty that was near Yardein? It seems that at one time it was a major force that controlled vast swaths of land from Yardein to the far east. It seems that successive kings built some kind of large building over many generations, but I don't know the details. Look it up in town.
