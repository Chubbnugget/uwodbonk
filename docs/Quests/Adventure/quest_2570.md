### Quest Contents
Somewhere on the island of Taiwan, it is said that there is a place where two sisters who were saddened by their fate ended their lives. It seems to be a fairly well-known story in Anping and other places, but a certain lady seems to be interested in this story. I want to know the location. Can I ask you to gather information and pinpoint the location?
