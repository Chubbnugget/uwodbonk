### Quest Contents
A sailor recently returned from a voyage and said he saw a strange, large fish. Since you investigated the sharks around here before, I'm sure you'll know who they are. Please talk to the person himself. It's been a while since I've been on land, and I think I'll be drinking at a bar in town by now.
