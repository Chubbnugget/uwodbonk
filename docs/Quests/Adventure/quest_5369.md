### Quest Contents
A request has come from the Adventurer's Guild. It seems that valuable materials related to the history of ancient Egypt have been stolen by a group of thieves. The bandit group itself has been destroyed, but the excavated items seem to have been abandoned, and they would like to ask for help searching for them. If you agree, please listen to the story of the adventurer guild master in Alexandria.
