### Quest Contents
This was a request from a certain nationalist. While walking on the outskirts of Pohang, I came across some strange ruins that had apparently been burnt down. Judging by the burnt ruins, it must have been a fine building, so they want us to investigate. Please consult with a scholar in Hanyang.
