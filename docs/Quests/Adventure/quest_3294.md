| **Quest Name** | Barren Plateau |  

### Quest Contents
This is a request for a geographical survey of the west side of Ireland. It seems that the plateau is expanding, and the aristocrats are thinking about building new mansions. So, I would like information about that plateau. If you're Angela at a bar in London, you'll probably hear all sorts of stories from sailors, and she might know something.
