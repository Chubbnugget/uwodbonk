| **Quest Name** | Cardinal and Delicious Bird |  

### Quest Contents
You were the one who researched the delicious black bird. Apparently Cardinal Tavera of Seville was looking for delicious birds. I think he'd be happy if I brought him the bird you researched. I'm sure there was a resident in this town who knew a lot about that bird, right?
