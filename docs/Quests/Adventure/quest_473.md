### Details of the quest [Temple where the sword sleeps]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | The temple where the sword rests |

### Quest Contents
I overheard it a little, but... I heard you heard some time ago that Queen Zenobia's sword is still somewhere. Actually, I heard a similar story from a Naples scholar. If you find that sword, wouldn't it be the great discovery of the century?
