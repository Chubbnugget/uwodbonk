### Quest Contents
There is a big island southeast of Calicut, have you ever been there? It seems like people live there and it's fairly developed. Rumor has it that there is a huge vein of gemstones. I'm sure there will be more people heading to the area for the gems, so please research the topography of the island and make a map.
