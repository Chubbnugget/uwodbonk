### Quest Contents
Snakes usually eat things like mice and eggs. However, the cobra in India is a poisonous snake whose main food is snakes. I can't kill it because it's a sacred animal, but I don't want it to bite me, so I want you to investigate its habitat. They say some young guy from Goa knows something.
