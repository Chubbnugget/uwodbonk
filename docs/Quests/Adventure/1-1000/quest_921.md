| **Quest Name** | Scarlet Hunter |

### Quest Contents
You seem to be involved in biological research. How about a job like this? At the request of a scholar in this town, he wants me to do some research on birds. You said it was a red bird, but I think it would be noticeable if it were flying in the sky. Anyway, let's hear from a scholar.
