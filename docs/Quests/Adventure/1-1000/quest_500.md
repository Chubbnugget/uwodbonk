# Quest [Landscape of Ancient Greece]

### Quest [Landscape of Ancient Greece] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Landscape of Ancient Greece |

### Quest Contents
I heard you went to see the Olympia ruins. The ruins are famous because they are even mentioned in Pausanias' Guide to Greece. I received a request to find a guide to Greece that was as close to the original as possible, so I thought I'd ask you. Check it out in Athens.
