### Quest Contents
Do you know anything about the Crusades? Even if you don't know the details, you've probably heard of the Lionheart King, who is famous for his battle with Saladin. For this request, I want you to find something related to the Lionheart King. I guess it's difficult because he was a king who went on many expeditions... Gather information in London
