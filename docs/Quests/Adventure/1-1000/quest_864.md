| **Quest Name** | Legendary King |

### Quest Contents
In Anatolia, there was the Hittite kingdom, famous for its history of iron manufacturing. And it seems that a certain legendary kingdom is connected to the Hittites. I have a request to gather information about that legend, but it might be difficult. I guess the only option is to just ask the locals.
