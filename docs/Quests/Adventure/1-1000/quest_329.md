### Quest [Laurent's Horn] Details

| **Quest Name** | Laurent's Horn |

### Quest Contents
Do you remember the request from Gijon where you resolved a child's fight? The owner of the manor who was the client told me that the ``Horn of Roland'' seems to still exist. If only I could get the horn after Durandal... I guess you have a good relationship with Laurent.
