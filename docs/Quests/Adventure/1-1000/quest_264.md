# Quest [Coastline of northwestern France]

### Quest [Coastline of northwestern France] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Coastline of northwestern France |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request to investigate the topography of northwestern France. There are narrow sea areas in that area, so we need accurate charts. The area I want you to look into is between Calais and Nantes. There are two peninsulas, so check the area. It would be a good idea to ask about the situation at Plymouth's tavern on the other side.
