### Quest Contents
In large churches and palaces, you will often see murals painted on the walls and ceilings. It's called a fresco, and it's painted directly on the wall. Apparently there is a huge ceiling painting painted by Michelangelo in Italy, I would like you to check this out. It would be a good idea to ask in Genoa.
