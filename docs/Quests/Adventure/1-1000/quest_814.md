| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Road to the Great Empire |

### Quest Contents
It is said that a large empire called the Songhai Empire flourished in the interior of northern Africa. I've heard that it's been declining recently as sea routes have become more popular. There are rumors that you can take a boat to the capital Timbuktu. I want you to check it out. Try gathering information in Saint-Georges.
