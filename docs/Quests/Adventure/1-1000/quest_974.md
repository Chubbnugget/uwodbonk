### Details of Quest [Foundation of Law]

| **Quest Name** | foundation of jurisprudence |

### Quest Contents
Do you have any knowledge of law? As for when the current law came into existence, it seems that its original form was in ancient Rome. Apparently the culmination of this work was created during the Byzantine Empire, and I've been asked to find the original. Just ask the Athenian scholars.
