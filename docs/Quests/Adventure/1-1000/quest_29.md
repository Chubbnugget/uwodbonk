| **Quest Name** | southern tip of africa |

### Quest Contents
I want you to find out about the Cape of Good Hope, which Bartolomeu Díaz once reached. There are a lot of storms around there, so the damage is incredible. That's why I want you to investigate the relationship between seasons and storms. Just ask the sailors of Saint-Georges. We'll talk about anything if we buy you a drink.
