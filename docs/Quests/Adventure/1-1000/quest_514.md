| **Quest Name** | Ancient Forbidden Book |

### Quest Contents
I can't reveal the client, but I received a request that can only be asked from someone I trust. Regarding ancient forbidden books, I would like you to investigate whether such books were designated as prohibited books. When it comes to books, it would be a good idea to gather information at the archives in Athens, where there are many old Greek books.
