| **Quest Name** | king who became a saint |

### Quest Contents
What kind of image do you have of a king? I don't get a very good impression of starting a war or being extravagant. However, there was apparently a king who was recognized as a saint by the Roman church. There is a request to search for the relic. Ask the priest of Marseilles
