### Details of the quest [Flowers that bloom just below the equator]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Flowers that bloom just below the equator |

### Quest Contents
Tropical regions have a lot of plants, probably because it's hot all year round. There are some flowers that won't bloom unless they are in that kind of environment. This time's request is that there is a plant that blooms from underwater, so I would like you to look into it. Ask me at a rest stop in Mogadishu.
