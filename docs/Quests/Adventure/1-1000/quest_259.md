# Quest [Hindu Supreme God]

### Quest [Hindu Supreme God] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Hindu Supreme God |

### Quest Contents
Hinduism, which is widespread in India, is a polytheistic religion, so it's interesting that there are many different gods. This time, my request is to find out about Brahma, the supreme god among them. It seems that the structure is a little different. Please take care of that as well. It would be a good idea to find someone in Calicut who knows the details.
