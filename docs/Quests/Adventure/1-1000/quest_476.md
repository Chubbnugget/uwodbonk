### Quest Contents
This was a request from a church official. Otto I was the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. It is said that he was crowned by the Pope and became the official Emperor of Rome, but I would like to find out more about how that happened. Apparently the coronation was held near Antwerp, so you should go and listen to the story.
