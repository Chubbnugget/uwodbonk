# Quest [Persian Sea]

### Quest [Persian Sea] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Persian Sea |

### Quest Contents
Do you know what Persia is? It refers to the area on the northern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Apparently people have been living here for a very long time. There's a huge bay in that area, and I've been asked to make a map of it. It seems they want to ask around the cape southeast of Basra.
