| **Quest Name** | blue turtle in the blue sea |

### Quest Contents
Have you ever seen a sea turtle? I heard that there are many different types of sea turtles, but apparently there is a blue sea turtle in the Eastern Mediterranean. I want you to look into that. Apparently they're often found around Greece, so you should go to a bar in Candia and ask if you know anything about them.
