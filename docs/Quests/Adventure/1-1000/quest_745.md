### Quest Contents
I have a request for you. They want you to look for a statue of the Virgin and Child. I guess they heard about your skill in finding the Annunciation painting in Italy and nominated you. First, talk to the priest in this town. This is a request from someone in Rome. If you do well, your name will become even more famous.
