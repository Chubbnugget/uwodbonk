### Quest Contents
I have received a request from a certain trading company to develop a route to Ceuta within 14 days, would you like to try it? Ceuta is the gateway city to the Mediterranean Sea. This is because it is an important base on the Mediterranean Sea. If you're an adventurer, there's no harm in trying it out!
