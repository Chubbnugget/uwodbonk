### Quest Contents
People with extra money spend a lot of money on things they don't need. Apparently there is a type of vessel made by carving gemstones. I've received a request to find out what kind of item it is. The story is that it was brought to Bordeaux, so ask the Bordeaux workshop craftsmen.
