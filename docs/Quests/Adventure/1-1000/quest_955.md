### Quest Contents
Have you seen Michelangelo's Pietà? It seems that da Vinci also painted a picture with a similar atmosphere to the Pietà. It seems to be a very nice item, and several art dealers are negotiating with it, but they don't seem to have any intention of selling it. Could you please try to negotiate with him to sell it to me?
