### Quest Contents
Did you discover the temple of the sun god? Apparently, a certain theologian heard about it and expressed interest. They wanted me to investigate the god that was worshiped there. I'm sure there's someone who knows a lot about Calicut? It would be difficult to sail to India again, but I asked for it.
