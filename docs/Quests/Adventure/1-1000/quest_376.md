### Quest Contents
Recently, paintings based on Greek and Roman mythology have become popular. This time's request is that a wonderful painting depicting Venus has been announced, so I'd like you to check it out. It's said to be by Botticelli, so if you ask in Pisa, you'll probably find someone who knows the details.
