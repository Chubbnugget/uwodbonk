| **Quest Name** | Fusion of Atlantic Coast Religions |

### Quest Contents
It is said that new religions are being born in the Caribbean, perhaps due to the increased movement of people across the Atlantic Ocean. The basic religion seems to be animism, but it seems to be a fusion of religions from various regions facing the Atlantic Ocean. I want you to look into this religion. Check it out in Santo Domingo.
