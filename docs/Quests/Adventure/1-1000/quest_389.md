| **Quest Name** | Say hello to the face of the city |

### Quest Contents
If you're going to make it as a navigator, you can't do it without being polite to the city's famous faces. So, wouldn't it be helpful later on if you said hello to the various people who played the role? Mr. Duckett lives in a mansion across the river from Westminster Square. It would be nice to meet you once and sell your face.
