| **Quest Name** | Indian Ocean Island |

### Quest Contents
This is a top secret request from the minister of this country. Around the Cape of Good Hope and heading north, there is a sea area dotted with several islands. It's about scouting the area. I think the nearest port was Mozambique? I'm sure you'll know the general route once you reach the departure point over there, so I'd like to ask you something.
