| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Big Pink Bird |

### Quest Contents
There are a lot of large birds in Africa, probably because the temperature is high and there is plenty of food. There are birds that are pink in color and form huge flocks. But I don't even know what I'm eating. I have received a request to investigate its ecology. Ask the scholars of Calicut for details.
