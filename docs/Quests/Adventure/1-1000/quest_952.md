### Quest Contents
When it comes to paintings and sculptures, many people think that Italy is the best. However, it seems that there are also excellent sculptors in France. It's one of the sculptor's works, but it doesn't seem to have been placed in the planned location. It would be a good idea to gather information in Nantes to find out why.
