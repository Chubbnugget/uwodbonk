# Quest [Egyptian Goddess]

### Quest [Egyptian Goddess] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Egyptian Goddess |

### Quest Contents
I heard that the temple of Isis, worshiped in ancient Egypt, is located in the middle of the Nile. Maybe there's a treasure there. But I haven't heard anything more specific than that. If you live around Cairo, a city in the Nile basin, you might be able to find out something.
