| **Quest Name** | Survey of the western Balearic Islands |

### Quest Contents
Do you know Palma? It's a city in the Balearic Islands. This time, I want you to check out the island to the west of Palma. This is a survey of the terrain. There are a lot of pirates in that area, and I'd be in trouble if someone secretly built a port there, so I'd like to do some research. Go check out what's going on at the bar in Parma.
