| **Quest Name** | statue holding a baby |

### Quest Contents
It was a request from a certain nobleman. That person loves traveling. It seems that he often reads Pausanias's Guide to Greece. I read your report on the Olympia ruins and wanted to verify what was written in the guidebook. I have informed the Adventurer's Guild in Athens about the subject of the investigation, so please ask them.
