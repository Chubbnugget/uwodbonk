### Quest Contents
Do you know what the Baltic Sea is? It is an inland sea east of the Scandinavian Peninsula. Apparently there is an island there called ``God's Island.'' There seems to be something going on. First of all, I would like you to do a geographical survey of the island. It would be best to ask the departure point official in Lübeck for the location.
