# Details of the quest [Baltic Sea Bay Survey]

### Details of the quest [Baltic Sea Bay Survey]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Survey of the bays of the Baltic Sea |

### Quest Contents
Although it's a bit far away, I have a job to do research in the eastern Baltic Sea. It seems to be a map of the bay. There are a lot of bays in that area, so you can't go wrong. It looks like the port of Riga is nearby, so do some research at the bar there. I'd be in trouble if a report was made sloppily.
