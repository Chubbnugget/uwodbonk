| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | overweight goose-like bird |

### Quest Contents
I heard you've been to the Mauritius Islands. There's a story that there's a strange bird over there, have you seen it? They say it's a fat goose-like bird and can't fly. I'm sure you'll be able to investigate this in detail, so I'd like to ask you a favor. Please do some research in Mozambique and then head out to investigate.

| **Discovery** | [Birds](docs/Categories/category_12.md) / [Dodo](docs/Quests/Other/1001-2000/quest_1957.md) This is a special bird that only lives in the Mauritius Islands. It is much larger than a chicken, and its wings are too small to fly. Their legs are thick and strong, but they cannot run very fast. The lack of predators on the island probably made it a laid-back bird. Overweight goose-like bird Rank: 5, Points: 7, Difficulty: 12, Experience points: 1,105 |
