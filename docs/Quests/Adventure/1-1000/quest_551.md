### Quest [Ancient European Peoples] Details

| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Ancient European Peoples |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a scholar who is researching history. Many ethnic groups have lived in Europe since ancient times, but there seems to be a lack of written information about these ethnic groups. Go to the archives in Marseille and search the collection for related descriptions.
