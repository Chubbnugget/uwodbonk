# Quest [Dignified Person]

### Quest [Dignified Person] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Dignified Person |

### Quest Contents
This is a request from a certain historian, but it seems that there is not enough information about Caesar's successor, Augustus. I think there are probably some scholars who are researching Naples... It might be a good idea to collect information from both books in the archives and scholars.
