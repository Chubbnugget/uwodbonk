### Quest Contents
It's a request from the military. They want us to survey the area around the mouth of the river near Istanbul and compile a map. Well, since that area is in Ottoman Turkish territory, there are a lot of patrols, so you can safely investigate, right? It's an easy job. I asked for one.
