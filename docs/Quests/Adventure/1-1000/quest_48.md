### Details of the quest [Southwest tip of the Iberian Peninsula]

| **Quest Name** | southwestern tip of the Iberian Peninsula |

### Quest Contents
I have a request for a topographical survey of the Iberian Peninsula. It seems like they want to investigate the southwest coastline. It's like a landmark when going on an ocean voyage. As you probably know, the closest city is Faro. Go ask Faro's tavern what's going on.
