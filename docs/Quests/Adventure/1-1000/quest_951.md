### Quest Contents
When you go to a church, you'll probably see various altarpieces. There are a lot of rules, for example, Maria's clothes are red and blue. However, there is a rumor that there is a religious painting that I have never seen before. It's a hot topic around Seville, so try asking about it at a bar in Seville.
