### Quest Contents
It seems that the master of the bar has entrusted the request. Apparently it was entrusted to him by a navigator whose ship was wrecked in battle. According to what I heard, the man was planning to make a fortune through trading, but instead he ran up debts and disappeared. Anyway, please check the request at the bar.
