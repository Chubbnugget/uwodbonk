### Quest Contents
There is a river in the eastern part of India that is revered and called the ``sacred river'' by the local people. It seems that ancient civilizations also flourished there. Apparently the estuary is complicated, so I'd like to ask you to investigate. Just ask the scholars of Calicut.
