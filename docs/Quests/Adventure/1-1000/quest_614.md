# Quest [Invisible Pharaoh]

### Quest [Invisible Pharaoh] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Invisible Pharaoh |

### Quest Contents
You probably know King Khufu's name. I've looked into the pyramids before. King Khufu was a pharaoh who had a huge pyramid built, but for some reason no representation of it has ever been found. There are no statues or paintings. I want you to look for it, what do you think? Check it out in Alexandria.
