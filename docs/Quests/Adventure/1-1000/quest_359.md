### Quest Contents
Yo. The client was very happy with the elephant report. ...Actually, perhaps they heard the rumor, and received a request from the Royal Palace of Portugal. They are planning to present an elephant to the Pope, but apparently there is some consultation regarding that. For more details, please ask directly at the Royal Palace in Lisbon. Please dress formally.
