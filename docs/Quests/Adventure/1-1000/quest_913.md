| **Quest Name** | White God's Messenger |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a scholar in this town to introduce him to a navigator who has researched man-eating tigers, and it looks like you're the one. It seems that the scholar has obtained a painting with a tiger in it, but there seems to be a problem with that tiger. First, please talk to the person himself.
