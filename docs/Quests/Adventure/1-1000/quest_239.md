### Quest Contents
Hey, some good information has come to me. Actually, there is a jewel associated with King Solomon from the Bible. There's a possibility that it's a Mayutsuba, but it could also be a hidden treasure. The source of the information is the bar master in this town. If you think you've been fooled, try listening to the story.
