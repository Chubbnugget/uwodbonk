### Quest Contents
Persepolis is the capital of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. A historian has asked me to investigate the ruins for research purposes. The dynasty was destroyed during Alexander the Great's expedition, and Persepolis was burnt to the ground, so the details are no longer known. First, collect information in Holmes.
