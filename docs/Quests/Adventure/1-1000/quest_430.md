| **Quest Name** | Giant and ferocious dolphin |

### Quest Contents
You know Iruka, right? It's not supposed to harm humans, but apparently there's a stupid, ferocious dolphin inside. It's said to be as big as a small mountain, so be careful. Or maybe it's a shark? In any case, ask the port official in Edinburgh.
