# Quest [Desert Fox]

### Quest [Desert Fox] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Desert Fox |

### Quest Contents
There is a story that a fox lives in the desert. I wonder if a fox can survive in a place like that? Anyway, I'm asking you to look for it. Even though it's called a fox, it seems to be quite different from the ones around here. That's right, I think you should ask around the rest area in Alexandria.
