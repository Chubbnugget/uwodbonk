### Details of the quest [Sea Snake and Water Snake]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Sea snake and water snake |

### Quest Contents
Previously, I received a report on the constellation Hydra, but this turned out to be even more troublesome... Apparently there is also a similar constellation with a water snake motif. I can't help but notice the difference! Ah, if this continues I won't be able to sleep at night. I'm sorry, but you should go talk to a scholar.
