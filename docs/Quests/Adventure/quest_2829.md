### Quest Contents
This was a request from a young man who loves literature who lives in this city. He seems to want to know about Huizong and Cai Jing, who are depicted as villains in Suikoden. I would like you to investigate and summarize whether he really existed, and if so, what kind of person he was. I heard about Suikoden from a scholar in Hangzhou, right? Can you tell me something else?
