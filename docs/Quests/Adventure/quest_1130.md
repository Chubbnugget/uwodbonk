| **Quest Name** | Rescator |

### Quest Contents
I asked him to investigate the development of bullfighting some time ago, and the Cardinal showed great interest in the report. This time's request was of course, what kind of existence was this star bullfighter? He wants me to find out why he became a star bullfighter. Thank you for your continued support.
