| **Quest Name** | Bible consultation |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a resident of Port Royal, would you be willing to give it a try? Well, the request is just a matter of consultation. I've heard that everything has to do with the Bible. If you're afraid of going to Port Royal to meet your client, I won't force you to do it, but I'd appreciate it if you would accept it.
