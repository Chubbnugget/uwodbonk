### Quest Contents
This is a request from the Earl of Sussex, who is at the Royal Palace in London. It seems like there's been talk among the bigwigs about whether there's any land that would be suitable for a resort. The Earl of Sussex is the representative, and a navigator knowledgeable about geography has been asked to investigate. First, let's hear from the person himself.
