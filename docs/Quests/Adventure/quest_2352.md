### Quest Contents
Did you know that there is a mountain near the city of Sakai? No, there are mountains everywhere, but the mountain near Sakai seems to be a religiously important place. A certain religious scholar seems to be interested in that mountain, so I'd like to ask him to investigate it. If you're a city official in Sakai, you probably know something.
