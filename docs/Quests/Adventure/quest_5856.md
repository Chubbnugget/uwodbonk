| **Quest Name** | A mouth that is not a frog |

### Quest Contents
Do you know what Gamaguchi is? I'm talking about the bags with mouthpieces that are commonly used around here, and a nobleman asked me to investigate, saying that there are other birds other than toads that have mouths similar to these. I'm sure he's somewhere around the southern island, so could you interview him in Jakarta?
