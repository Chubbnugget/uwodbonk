### Quest Contents
Do you know about the Persian Wars in ancient Greece? There's a history book that summarizes how it happened, but I've been getting requests to look up the original source. I heard that a scholar in Seville knows a lot about this, so please ask him about it. The scholar is in the library.

Search inside the Genoa church *Around the wall on the left of the 6th chair from the front seat on the left side *Along the wall closer to the altar than the second pillar from the altar towards the church entrance *In Seville, it didn't appear even after using 200 coins, and in Lisbon it appeared only once, so it seems to be a Lisbon-only quest, so I deleted Seville in Town. 2016/03/14 Experience point at discovery 120 Discovery card experience point 60 Bonus quest Sunday |
