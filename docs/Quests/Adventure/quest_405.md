| **Notes** | 1. Calicut Library Scholar 2. Calicut Tavern Sailor 3. Masulipatam Tavern Sailor x 2 4. Calcutta Sailor x 2 5. Calcutta Town Official 6. Northeast coast of the Bay of Bengal, around 11m west and 153m north of the upside-down rock in the northeast Ecological survey *Go almost due north from the upside-down rock and near the bushes near the end *Even when I used a dictionary, I used about 50 pieces of recruitment paper to answer the questions. So, if there is no language, it may not come out at all. *Even if you don't have a language, you can get it in less than 10 pages. Language doesn't seem to be required. *Although the language is not required, it seems that the quest itself is difficult to appear. I recommend using 10 request letters for biology to issue a quest. *I received 3 request letters without any language. In the end it's all about luck. |
