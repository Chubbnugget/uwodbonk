| **Quest Name** | Toy-like percussion instrument |  

### Quest Contents
A while back, I found some toy-like instruments and percussion instruments made by hollowing out the inside of a tree, right? Apparently there are similar instruments in the western part of this continent, and the guild has received a request to find out what they are. The owner of the trading post in this town might be able to give you some information.
