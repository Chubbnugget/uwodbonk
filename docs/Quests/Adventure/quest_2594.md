### Quest Contents
I've got a request from an archaeologist from Candia. He wants to take a closer look at the chest ornament of Ankhesenamun, which was reported to have been discovered at Luxor Temple, so he asked if you could somehow deliver it to him. It's quite a difficult request, but I believe you can do it.
