### Quest Contents
This is a request from a scholar in this city. Apparently, an unnaturally shaped piece of limestone was found at the foot of a mountain that rises to the east of Istanbul. First of all, he wants you to search for that mountain. For now, wouldn't it be a good idea to gather some information in Istanbul?
