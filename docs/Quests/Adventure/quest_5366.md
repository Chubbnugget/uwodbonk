### Quest Contents
It was a request from a certain nobleman. He seems to have come up with the idea that in ancient times, when various technologies were underdeveloped, participating in hunting was a dangerous but honorable thing, and to confirm this, he wants us to look into how hunting is depicted in Greek mythology. How about asking a Neapolitan scholar?
