# Quest [Fruit Crossing the Sea]

### Quest [Fruit Crossing the Sea] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Fruit Crossing the Sea |

### Quest Contents
A request has been received from a trading post in Zanzibar to deliver three boxes of noni. It seems that the fruit has drifted to Zanzibar, and the trading post owners who have shown interest have contacted the guilds in each city. It's a common fruit around here, but I guess it's rare in Zanzibar.
