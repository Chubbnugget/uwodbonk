Genoa Merchant Guild, give 30 volumes of damask to the Merchant Guild Master *Purchase the damask in Beirut *Within 30 days, the number of days is surprisingly tight, so it's a good idea to stock it in advance (During the commissioned voyage from Potosi, it takes 10 days to go from Venice to Beirut, and from there it takes about 13 to 15 days to go to Genoa) *You can accept quests with R1+2 rowboats, but unless you are in R3 status, you will not be able to obtain the third piece of information from the Venetian merchant guild master. (Fleet sharing of rowing skills is possible.) *R3 rowboats and 10,000 trade reputations are required to issue the quest. |
