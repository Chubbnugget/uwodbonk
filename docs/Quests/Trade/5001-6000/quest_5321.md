# Details of the quest [Knife made of phantom metal]

### Details of the quest [Knife made of phantom metal]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | A knife made of mysterious metal |

### Quest Contents
I heard from Mr. Paracelsus in Venice, have you ever tried "alchemy of transmutation"? If so, why not try producing something like ``a throwing knife that demonstrates the true value of a phantom metal''? I don't know the method, but if you succeed, please give it to Paracelsus.
