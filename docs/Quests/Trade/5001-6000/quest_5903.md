### Details of the quest [Business related to gold rush]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Business related to gold rush |

### Quest Contents
I would like to request additional research on the gold rush that I previously requested. In the last report, I learned that there are likely to be many business opportunities other than gold mining, but I was wondering if you could investigate what kinds of businesses are actually successful. I think the most efficient way would be to ask a merchant in San Francisco.
