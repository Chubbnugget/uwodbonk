### Quest Contents
I would like the Portuguese minister to deliver a roll of Indian chintz. This is a request from a commercial association that wants the minister, who is always complaining about pepper, to know that there are wonderful textiles like this. I know it's going to be a long journey, but please don't burn it on the way.
