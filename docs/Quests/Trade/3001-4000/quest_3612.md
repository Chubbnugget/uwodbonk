| **Quest Name** | Delivery request again |

### Quest Contents
Good morning. I have some delivery work to do, but could you please do it for me? The client is anonymous, but the item is not dangerous. The delivery address is St. Petersburg... It's a somewhat memorable request. Is it my imagination? Well, it's just a delivery job. If you're interested, I'll tell you more about it.
