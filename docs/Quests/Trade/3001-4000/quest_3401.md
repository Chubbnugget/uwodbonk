| **Quest Name** | Carlota makes a decision |

### Quest Contents
Another request from Christina. They want 100 pieces of Pupuran delivered within 20 days. Poupurin was often made by confectionery artisans in the lake town in the past, but recently there have been fewer and fewer artisans who can make it. I haven't seen a pupuran tree made by stacking them up lately...
