I have received an urgent request from Cardinal Tavera. From what I've heard, it seems like something was stolen by an enemy country. The details will be communicated directly by the cardinal. It smells like kina, so be careful!

Trade fame 50,000 Combat fame 10,000 *For the first time, it is possible that you only need job change experience. (A state where you can change jobs without a letter of recommendation) (2021.07.28: Only the job change experience remained in red.) *It seems that the quest will not be presented unless you are a money exchanger at least the first time. If you look it up in the recommended search, it will be displayed in red letters = conditions not met for occupations other than money exchanger, and if you change jobs to money exchanger, it will be displayed in white letters. *It was possible to contract with a company other than a money exchanger. It has been on hiatus for a long time, and it is unclear whether it was contracted in the past. I definitely have past experience as a money changer. However, there is no past job display in the guild. *I was unable to accept the offer due to the mitigation log appearing during the PT introduction, so I submitted it myself. *I have no experience changing jobs as a money changer, have no precious metal skills, and joined the Marine Corps. *The person being introduced to the quest must be a money changer. *It was also presented to me as an accountant (2020.12.21) *The admiral's quest has been partially relaxed due to special conditions being met, and you will not be able to receive introductions. If you accept the money exchanger's quest and become a money exchanger, you will be able to receive an introduction (2021.10.2) Recommended search is displayed in red (2022.02.06) *Bonus Quest Sunday If the age of the world you are currently in is close to the age of Chrono Quest, the presentation conditions will be relaxed. |
