### Quest Contents
This is a troublesome situation. The city's royal palace has requested that 200 barrels of wine be prepared within 30 days. As a merchant, you would know what an insane request this is, right? Please ask other merchant friends to help you and deliver it to the guild master. Don't forget, the Time Limit is only 30 days!
