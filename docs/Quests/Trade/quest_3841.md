### Details of the quest [Mysterious important mission]

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | mysterious important mission |

### Quest Contents
This is a job from the merchant guild master of this city. It seems like they want to rely on a trusted navigator. He said with a serious face that it was an important mission, but he didn't tell me what kind of job it was. It must be quite an important job. If you want to accept it, please ask me directly.
