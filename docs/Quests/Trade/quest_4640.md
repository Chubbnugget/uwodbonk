| **Quest Name** | Shipwright's troubles |

### Quest Contents
We have received a request from a shipwright in Port Royal to deliver a large quantity of coconut fiber. 500 bundles is an incredible number. It must be hard just to load it up, but I don't really have anyone to ask... They sell it both in this town and in neighboring towns, so I'll ask for it anyway.
