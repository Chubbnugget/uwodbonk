| **Quest Name** | Novelty Money |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a trading post owner in San Francisco to deliver 5 boxes of Dragonfly incense. I wonder if the economy is so good that they can buy such luxury goods. I want to play with you! Well, work is work anyway. It's going to be a long journey, but please be careful of pirates!
