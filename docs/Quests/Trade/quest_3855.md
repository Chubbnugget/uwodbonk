### Quest [Gold Dust Delivery] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Gold Dust Delivery |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from the owner of a trading post in Lima to urgently deliver 10 bags of gold dust. I guess I was in a big hurry, because the letters were all messed up and hard to read. Hey, why don't you accept the request thinking you're helping someone?
