### Quest Contents
I have a special request for you. I want you to deliver 5 boxes of gold to Tenochtitlan. I usually give it to the tool shop owner, but this time the client is unknown. The only thing is that he will only talk to those who have received the request and brought the money. For now, take the money and head to the imperial capital.
