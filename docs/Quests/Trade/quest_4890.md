| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Bar Master's Efforts |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from the Tavern Master in San Francisco to deliver 30 boxes of lavender. Isn't it quite fashionable to have lavender in a bar? I also want to have a glass in a place with such a nice atmosphere... So, it's going to be a long journey, but I'm looking forward to seeing you!
