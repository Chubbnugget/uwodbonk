### Details of the quest [Take a break with tea]

| **Quest Name** | Take a break with tea |

### Quest Contents
At the request of a town girl here, she wants me to deliver 5 bags of tea to the members of a theater company in London. I think it would be a good idea to stop by Ceylon and buy some tea. It's a local specialty, so if you stock up on a lot and sell the excess in London, you're sure to get a good price.
