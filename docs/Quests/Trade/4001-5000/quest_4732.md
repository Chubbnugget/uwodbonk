### Quest Contents
I've received a request to deliver 50 barrels of sesame seeds, but since the shipping destination is in the East, I don't have a voyager available. Can you do it for me? If you can do it, I would like you to deliver the goods to a trader in Sakai. It will be transported over a long distance, so please be careful.
