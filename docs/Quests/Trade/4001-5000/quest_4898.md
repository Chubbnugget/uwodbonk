### Details of the quest [A Young Merchant's Ambition]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Ambition of a young merchant |

### Quest Contents
A merchant in San Francisco wants 30 barrels of raisins. Dried fruit is easy to preserve and has a lot of nutrients, so I guess it's popular in emerging towns. It's going to be a long journey, but please be careful about your goods and pirates!
