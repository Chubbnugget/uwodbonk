# Quest [Plenty of Coconuts]

### Quest [Plenty of Coconuts] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Plenty of Coconuts |

### Quest Contents
I've received a delivery request from the owner of a rest stop in Hawaii. It seems that what they want delivered is 50 bags of coconuts. If you're headed from here, it would be a good idea to procure it around Hiva Oa. Let's get ready and head over so that we can arrange everything properly and deliver it.
