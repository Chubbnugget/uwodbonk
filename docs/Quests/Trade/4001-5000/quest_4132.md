| **Quest Name** | A man who understands the difference |

### Quest Contents
I've received a somewhat strange request from a scholar in Athens... They asked me to deliver 10 barrels of olive oil. Speaking of Athens, it's famous for making olive oil, so I think it's best to buy it locally. Well, buy it and deliver it to me.
