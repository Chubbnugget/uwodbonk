### Quest Contents
A request to procure clove spices has arrived from Jakarta. It seems to be a rare spice, but I'd like to have 10 barrels delivered, so there's plenty of room, right? If you're looking for items, you should be able to get them around Ternate. He said he bought it and delivered it to the owner of a rest stop in Jakarta.
