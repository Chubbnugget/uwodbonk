### Quest Contents
A charlatan in San Francisco wants you to deliver 5 boxes of Western armor. I wonder why a charlatan would want some armor. I wonder if he knows more about the market price of antiques... Well, whatever the reason, work is work. It's going to be a long journey, but be careful of pirates.
