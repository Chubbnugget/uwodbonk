### Quest [Cooking Essentials] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Cooking Essentials |

### Quest Contents
I keep getting requests from sales staff in Jakarta to procure a lot of seasonings. The one I cut out was a seasoning that you can get around Nyoku Mutchu Yardin. It would be great if they could buy 10 barrels of that and ship it to Jakarta. If you're serious, just ask.
