| **Quest Name** | The leather next door |

### Quest Contents
A merchant in San Francisco has requested that you deliver 20 rolls of leather. I'm sure it's a wilderness town, and there are a lot of wild cows, so there shouldn't be a problem with leather. What kind of decision did you make to order this far away?
