# Quest [Gun Made of Mysterious Metal]

### Quest [Gun Made of Mysterious Metal] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Gun Made of Mysterious Metal |

### Quest Contents
I heard from Mr. Paracelsus in Venice, have you ever tried "alchemy of transmutation"? If so, why not take on the challenge of producing something like ``a gun that demonstrates the true value of the phantom metal''? The method is not clear to me, but if you succeed, please give it to Mr. Paracelsus.
