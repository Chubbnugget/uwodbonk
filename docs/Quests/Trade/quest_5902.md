### Details of the quest [Reality of Gold Rush]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | The reality of the gold rush |

### Quest Contents
I heard that San Francisco is experiencing a gold rush right now, but I'd like you to investigate whether the gold miners are really making a profit. If too much money were to be spent, it would have an impact on the market. Wouldn't it be quicker to actually go to the site and talk to gold diggers?
