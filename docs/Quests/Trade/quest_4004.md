| **Quest Name** | Signs of a coffee boom |

### Quest Contents
I received a great request. This is from a bar master in Lisbon, and he would like 100 bags of coffee delivered within 80 days. Coffee is commonly grown around here in Abidjan and Luanda, but the problem is the quantity... Please organize the hold well and stock up.
