Princess Marguerite of Nantes 2. Veronica Franco of Ragusa 3. Rossana of Istanbul Sewing R13 is required even when delivering (Even if you don't have R13 on your own, you can support the fleet. You can complete the quest with R13 including +1 from the disciple) The dress to be delivered must be the basic color (green). If you change it to another color, you will need to use sewing tools to change it back to green. Items purchased from others or used items with reduced durability are also OK. If you want to make your own, you will need the Mode Design Collection Volume 5. A total of about 240 barrels of raw silk are needed for the three garments. You can spend half that amount on satin and fine clothing. However, be careful as the recipe was looted from the Venetian Merchant Fleet, so if you try to get it on your own, you'll have to face the enemy.
