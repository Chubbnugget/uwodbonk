# Details of the quest [Spear made of phantom metal]

### Details of the quest [Spear made of phantom metal]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | A spear made of phantom metal |

### Quest Contents
I heard from Mr. Paracelsus in Venice, have you ever tried "alchemy of transmutation"? If so, why not take on the challenge of producing something like ``a spear that demonstrates the true value of a phantom metal''? The method is not clear to me, but if you succeed, please give it to Mr. Paracelsus.
