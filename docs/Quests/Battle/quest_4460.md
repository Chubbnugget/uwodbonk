Lately, it seems that foreign merchant ships passing through Yardein have been attacked by pirates. If things continued like this, business would increase, and merchants started asking him to subdue the Gulf of Siam pirates. You're good at it, aren't you?　I lent you a hand here. If we can sink 12 of their ships, we'll be fine.
