Dili Departure Station Official Dili North Subjugation target Tukanbusi pirates 4 to 8 operational heavy galleys (when solo) Use rowing, stringing, and evasion to rush in while shooting the bow Meteora. *Basically, the target is BOX melee, so be careful of confused melee. It would be good to have a double shot defense as the cannon bakasaka will come at you even during melee combat. On the ship side, there were no cannons, no rams, strong melee and artillery fire, and I got about 1000 experience points by sinking 4 ships.
