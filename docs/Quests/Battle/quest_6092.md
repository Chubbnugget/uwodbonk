| **Quest Name** | Killing pirates north of Benghazi |  

### Quest Contents
This is an advanced training assignment for navigators who aspire to become military personnel. I want them to actually subjugate pirates and prove their abilities. The target of subjugation is the Tubruk pirates who appear north of Benghazi. Judging from the fact that they were riding in the galley, it can be inferred that they were good at hand-to-hand combat. Be careful when approached
