# Quest [Pathetic Pirates]

### Quest [Pathetic Pirates] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Pathetic Pirates |

### Quest Contents
It's a strange story, but a merchant ship sailing south of Montpellier was attacked by pirates. However, they were apparently frightened by the merchant ship's guns and ran away. On top of that, I've been getting requests from several referrals to get rid of them. It would be a good idea to ask the locals how this happened.
