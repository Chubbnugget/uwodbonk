| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Sheran capture fleet |  

### Quest Contents
Apparently there are some incredible pirates who land around Copenhagen and wreak havoc. We've received a request from the Hanseatic League to subjugate them. It's a pretty tough opponent, but please do something! I'm supposed to receive a report on the investigation at the departure point in Copenhagen.
