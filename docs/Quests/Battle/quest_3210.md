I was able to safely deliver the requested items. However, from the words of the city officials, it seems that something serious is happening. What on earth is a serious situation?

Town Official (Repair 11 required) Subjugation target: Islamic detached fleet, 4-6 Galeas appear when solo, 8-10 Galeas appear when fleet Encounter point: Sea near Suez, go south from the city, around the branch (may not appear if you are driving on the shore side) Start with the enemy flagship attacking from behind. The enemy's skills are rowing, coming alongside, and evasion. The artillery fire is reasonably strong (150 for armor 32, around 50 for armor 65).Melee combat is not so strong, but if you attack the flagship, the surgeons will come flying at you with great force. There are also a lot of repairs (each costing about R15), so if you take on a poor hand-to-hand combat solo, there's a good chance you'll be turned into a beehive. Even if you don't use hand-to-hand combat, if you get surrounded you can die from gunfire. If you just want to defeat it, just stop near the line and sink it from the ship that approaches. This quest does not appear in Seville. Therefore, change the target Town |
