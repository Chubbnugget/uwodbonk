### Quest Contents
I have a request from Mr. Henry Morgan, Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica. It seems that the traitor in the family you subdued before was connected to the X remnants of the Orthodox Buccaneers. Could you please subjugate about 12 ships to cut off the root of the disaster? The bar master should know where you are.
