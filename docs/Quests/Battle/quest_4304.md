| **Notes** | Jamaica town official x 2 Search for and capture NPC "François Roronois" wandering around the islands north of Havana (he won't attack from the other side). Use the 5-ship fleet of the line and use the reinforcement request skill. The bombardment has tremendous power, but the melee strength is average, so it is effective to engage in multiple battles like with the jar. |
