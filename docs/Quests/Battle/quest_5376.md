# Quest [Rough Caribbean]


### Quest [Rough Caribbean] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Rough Caribbean |  

### Quest Contents
It seems that the security situation in the Caribbean is getting worse recently. It has always been a place with a lot of ruffians, but now there are rumors that some privateer pirates are active there, and that it has been attacked by an unknown ship, so the situation is unsettling. This time, I would like you to check the situation first. Gather information in San Juan.
