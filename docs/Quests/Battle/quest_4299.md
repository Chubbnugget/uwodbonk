| **Quest Name** | Buccaneer subjugation request |

### Quest Contents
You know a lot about the Caribbean Sea, right? I've received an anonymous request from you. It seems that buccaneers with the English emblem have been rampaging near Jamaica recently, and I'd like you to subdue them. The target number for subjugation is 8 ships. There seems to be some ulterior motive, but I'll ask for your help.
