| **Quest Name** | Defeating pirates in the Northwest Passage |  

### Quest Contents
Recently, there has been some looting damage in the Beaufort Sea area. The culprits are a group of thugs who came from around here, but they seem to be expanding their sphere of influence. The guild couldn't leave things like this, so they decided to send out a subjugation request. If you're willing to take on the job, please talk to me again.
