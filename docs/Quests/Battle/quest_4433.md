Nice to see you here. I have a request for you. He chased the pirates who had been ravaging the Adriatic Sea into the Gulf of Corinthiakos, north of the Peloponnese, where they barricaded themselves. Their fleet is stationed at the entrance to the bay. Destroy it. I asked for it!

| **Notes** | Engaged with the Patre blockading fleet at the entrance to Corinthiakos Bay. Combat 2-3 Barsha ships (Durability 38, 5 sailors, Skills used: Defense) The location is near the hollowed-out entrance just above Athens. *There are no galleys around Corinthiakos Bay, and there are only 1 to 3 Barsha NPCs. There are no threats other than the algae at the entrance. *Since the only skill is ``defense'', it would be a good idea to give it a try if you have just acquired ``shooting'' at the Vene Maritime Guild or if you have acquired a matchlock shooting gun. On the other hand, if it is an "assault", there will be counter damage. Be more careful of algae than pirates. 9600 at the time of annihilation. Bonus Quest Sunday |
