### Details of the quest [Procurement of shells]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Procurement of shells |

### Quest Contents
Since you are a skilled person, this is a request I can ask you. Could you act as a courier to dangerous areas? I would like you to procure about 20 boxes of shells and deliver them to Suez. There are a lot of pirates in that area, so it's tough, but will you do me a favor? You can buy shells in this town.

| **Notes** | Supply Corps Job Change Quest Deliver 20 shells to Suez. You can buy it at Risu and bring it in, or you can move it by liner and produce it locally, whichever you prefer. When you deliver it to a town official, the quest will be updated to "Caught up in a Courier." * Target for subjugation: Islamic separate fleet - 4-6 Galeas when solo, 8-10 Galeas when in fleet. All enemy ships have durability of 700 and crew of 150. Be careful as the bombardment is quite strong (150 damage taken with 32 armor, around 50 damage with 65 armor). Also, the Red Sea, including the encounter point, is a breeding ground for algae, so it is safe to have it exterminated. |
