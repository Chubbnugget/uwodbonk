### Quest Contents
We've received a message from the guild's patrol team that they've spotted a privateer fleet heading north off the coast of West Africa! The navy is on its way and will soon engage the main force, but it seems that some of the divisions are continuing north toward this city. I want you to intercept that fleet within 30 days. Please check the details at the departure point in Faro.
