### Quest [Great Port of Alexandria] Details

| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Great Port of Alexandria |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from the Maritime Guild in Alexandria. It seems that a scholar has asked me to tell him about the old great port, but I wonder if he's asked the wrong person... There might be something wrong. For now, let's hear from the maritime guild master in Alexandria.
