| **Notes** | 1.London Departure Station Official 2.Stockholm Tavern Master 3.Stockholm Tavern Sailor x3 4.Stockholm Departure Officer *10 ships of the line (solo/fleet alike) (Durability 980, Sailor 100) One of the three most villainous maritime quests - Use "Thor's Thunder" on the first shot at the opening (around 150 damage to the fleet + almost certainly destroys one cannon) (Also, use "Thor's Thunder" every time reinforcements arrive in the battlefield) - If you start a battle while following the admiral, the two ships behind you will be completely surrounded. ・If you challenge melee, your opponent will retreat repeatedly, and if you decide to retreat, you will be faced with concentrated fire from enemy ships. ・When you receive enemy fire, you will be confused about 70% of the time, and your sails will be damaged and flooded frequently (avoidance R10 + 2 for you). ・Use horizontal, ballistic, and rapid fire (if you get hit in the horizontal range, you will be able to take over 400 points)・The melee number is atk 200, the withdrawal rate is quite high, and the power of assault is also high. ・When one ship falls, all remaining enemy ships use "Earth Spirit Mark" (if used by a PC, it will do about 35 damage to a single ship + occasionally destroy the cannon). ・If you go along the land to the east of the Gulf of Bothnia, it is easy to get a position where you can catch chestnuts. ・In times of confusion, immediately use the flag of calm, and also use the mysterious feather fan.
