### Details of the quest [Relief request from the research team]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Request for relief from the research team |

### Quest Contents
This was a request from a research team dispatched to Greenland Island. Apparently, pirates frequently appear in the south of the island and interfere with investigations. The south side of that island seems like it would be easy for pirates to use as a hideout. They'll probably give up after we defeat about 10 ships.
