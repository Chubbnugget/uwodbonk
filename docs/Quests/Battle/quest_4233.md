The number of soldiers is 34 to 46. Once you start fighting in hand-to-hand combat, you will be surrounded and attacked, but your melee ability is not high. However, since the cap is relatively fast at Lv28, if you want to do the same ☆7 normally, I think it would be better to do "Large Fleet" such as Genoa. |
