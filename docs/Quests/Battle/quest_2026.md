# Quest [Suspicious Ship Subjugation]

### Quest [Suspicious Ship Subjugation] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Suspicious Ship Subjugation |

### Quest Contents
I've received a request from a certain Chasuki who has nominated you. They want you to sink a ship anchored west of Tumbes. It's not a very big ship, but Tumbes is currently being used as a base by European explorers, and there's a lot of blood in the air... If there is any suspicious behavior, I would like to request additional investigation.
