### Quest Contents
Further west of Calais, the peninsula that borders the Bay of Biscay is the Brittany Peninsula, the setting for this work. It seems that a privateer fleet is appearing. It appears that the merchant fleet transiting through Calais is being devastated. I've asked the trading post in Calais town to compile it, so please check it out.
