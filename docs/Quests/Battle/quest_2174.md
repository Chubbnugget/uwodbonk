# Details of the quest [Salamandra Pirate's Castle]


### Details of the quest [Salamandra Pirate's Castle]

| **Quest Name** | Salamandra Pirate's Castle |  

### Quest Contents
I've been asked to investigate the Salamandra Pirates, a formidable pirate group that has been ravaging the Aegean Sea lately. Apparently, the military had finally gotten serious about subjugating them. It is an important job for which the guild will pay additional compensation. I'll just ask you one thing!
