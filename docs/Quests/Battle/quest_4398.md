### Quest Contents
I have a request to subdue pirates, can you do it for me? Apparently they're the ones who are wreaking havoc around the city of Bahia. First, it would be a good idea to ask questions in the streets of Bahia. I'm telling you not to let your guard down, but with a skill like yours, you'll have no problem dealing with any kind of pirate.
