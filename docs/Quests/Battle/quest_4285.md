| **Notes** | 1. Defeated 15 "Mataram Privateer Fleet" in the Java Sea area Mataram Privateer Fleet: Galeas x 2 Skills used: Penetrating/horizontal artillery is powerful. At close range, even from the side can cause serious damage. If you get a chestnut on a bottom durable ship, it may be a single blow. If it's far away, it will head straight towards you while firing its bow cannon, but if it gets close, it will fire a merry-go-round. If you keep your distance and aim at the bow chestnut with a long-range cannon, you can defeat it smoothly. |
