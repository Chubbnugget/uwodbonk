### Details of the quest [Lifeline of Trade]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | lifeline of trade |

### Quest Contents
The small islands at the mouth of the Nile produce a lot of cotton. Cotton is an important trade item for this town. However, it seems that there are pirates who land on the small island and steal the cotton. I guess I can't leave this alone. I'm sorry, but please do some questioning in this town and subdue these guys.
