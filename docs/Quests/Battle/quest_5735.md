# Quest [Steamboat Battle]


### Quest [Steamboat Battle] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Steamboat Battle |  

### Quest Contents
It seems there are pirates who only attack steamships. The lack of combat ability is probably what attracts them. Let's head to the northwest of the Azores to exterminate them, where pirates are frequently sighted. Pirates won't show up unless you're on a steamship.

I forgot to look at the melee numbers, but there were 80 sailors on the other side. Since he doesn't do anything in particular, you can attack him repeatedly as a merchant. |
