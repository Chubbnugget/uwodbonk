| **Quest Name** | Hunting sailors |

### Quest Contents
Have you noticed that there are more novice sailors around Seville lately? It's understandable since we live in the age of the sea, but it seems that there are a lot of pirates out there who are targeting these fledgling ships and making a quick buck. Ask the bar master about the situation and help us get rid of it.
