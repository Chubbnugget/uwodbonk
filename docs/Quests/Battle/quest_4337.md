| **Notes** | 1. Calicut Tavern Master 2. Calicut Departure Officer 3. Near (3399,4284) one day northwest of Calicut Solo: Heavy Galley x 4-6 Fleet: Heavy Galley x 10 Skill: Penetration Horizontal Fire Melee: Attack 188 Defense 91 Crew 120 Experience 624-828 Fame 210-312 (Artillery) Lv50) Armor is 56, long-range 1-50, short-range 1-150, and one-hit death with chestnuts and equipment wear are severe. At the start, the flagship and others are a little far apart, so move as if you were grouped together and fire at medium and long range. With Perrier + ballistics, it will sink in 2 chestnuts, so it's easier to fight from a distance. If you don't have Karone or ballistics, it might be a little tough. Its movements are easy to understand, so you can quickly finish it off with mines and ballistic cannons. If it's horizontal trajectory penetration, it's one hit even if it's not a chestnut. Of course it depends on the R, but the shelling is painful, but you can easily go with Carone. Bonus Quest Saturday |
