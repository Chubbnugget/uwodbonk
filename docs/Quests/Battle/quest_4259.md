| **Notes** | 1. Lima Departure Officer Subjugation Target 10 Paracas Pirates (off the coast just south of Lima) Near 12805.5435 Solo: 4 to 6 combat galleons Long range, but weak in both artillery and hand-to-hand combat 2009/12/8 Challenged with bottom durable combat galleon Lv41 (solo). Gunnery: Ballistics/Rapid Fire Melee: None? They appear scattered neatly in all directions and approach your ship while firing at you. Since hand-to-hand combat will also be active, mines seem to be essential. It is also frequently used by surgeons. I think the cannonball is a grape bullet (because I was confused a lot) If it's a front/back critical, it hits more than 300. By the way, we have two games and two losses.
