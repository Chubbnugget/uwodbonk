| **Notes** | 1. Listen to the stories of the customers at the Zanzibar rest area 2. Listen to the story of the owner of the Zanzibar rest area 3. Fight against the Rakkajib pirates near due east of Mombasa (2170, 4850) *For those who want to avoid hand-to-hand combat with the enemy * You cannot use the tactic of anchoring close to the boundary line and firing at the enemy!! This is because the enemy ship will successfully come alongside even at the last possible moment. Rakkajibu Pirates have 4 to 6 large galleys (when solo). They do not do any artillery fire. Melee ability is about 105 sailors, 160 attacks, and 80 defenses. Killed 4 ships with mines and gained 392 experience and 66 fame. At battle level 29, defeating 6 ships with cannon fire gave me 543 experience and 118 fame, and when I reported it I got 225 experience and 90 fame. There is a ram attack, so don't forget the materials. |
