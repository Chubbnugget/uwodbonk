| **Quest Name** | Battle of Cajamarca |

### Quest Contents
Atahualpa won the recent battle on Mount Chimborazo, and the majority of the Inca Empire appears to have been decided. I received a call from an Inca warrior who said that behind the scenes, a man named Pizarro seemed to be plotting something nefarious. I want you to head to Tumbes to find out their true intentions, engage in battle if necessary, and stop the conspiracy.
