### Quest Contents
To the east of this city is an island called Corsica, and to the south of that island is a strait. It's a very important route for ships headed to the southeast, so there are quite a few pirates waiting to ambush it. So, I want you to subdue the pirates around here. For more details, ask the trader at the bar.
