| **Quest Name** | Private Order |

### Quest Contents
As a pirate, this is the perfect job for you. A request has been received from Arguin to attack a Portuguese merchant fleet sailing around Las Palmas. The merchant fleet is protected by the navy, so it should be quite formidable. It would be a good idea to ask about the schedule at Madeira, where the merchant fleet calls at the port.

| **Notes** | 1. Talk to the departure point official in Madeira 2. Go south from Las Palmas 2-4 heavy carracks + 2 commercial carracks Surgical skills and defense are often used in melee, so if you are solo, it is easier to sink them with artillery unless you are good at melee (armor is thin and repair frequency is low) Heavy carracks: 120 people Commercial carracks: 50 people Skills used: Evasion, ballistics, repair, use grape bullets Frequent messages saying "I was hit by grape bullets from the Portuguese Armed Merchant Fleet, and my energy has been reduced by 50!" *When I faced off against a fleet of 58 combat Pinne, only artillery, and 2 heavy carracks and 2 commercial carracks, I consumed 34 materials and 23 shells, and the durability was about 40 auxiliary sails, 30 armor, 15 cannons, 10 figureheads, and 5 poop towers. I got 14,080 in spoils and gained 150 proficiency in penetration skills. (Sailors lost 40 and recovered to 57/58) ⇔For 4 heavy carracks and 2 commercial carracks, surgical rescue was used, 25 sailors were lost, 45 materials were used up, and 0 were sunk, resulting in a ceasefire, and a rematch after resupply.
