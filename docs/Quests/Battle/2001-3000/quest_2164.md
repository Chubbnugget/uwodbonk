| **Quest Name** | Robust ground formation |

### Quest Contents
You know the Duke of Alba, right? He is a man who has been interfering in every way possible to bring this country under Spanish rule. This is a request from those who resist the Duke of Alba. I would like you to look into the battle formations that Spain uses in land battles. It would probably be quicker to ask the guard in Seville.
