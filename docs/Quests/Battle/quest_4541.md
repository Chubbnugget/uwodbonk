| **Notes** | 1: Depart and engage north towards Pemba Island. Subjugation target: "Pemba Island Raid Fleet" Formation: 2-3 light carracks (solo) * Only repair skills are fired repeatedly. Recommended as it is very close, capped at Lv31. In addition, the information in the quest says "Ambush on the north side", but in reality the battle will take place on the south side (normally it appeared on the north side).In my case, I did not get the above items, but got 16 zinc ores and 1 emerald.Perhaps because I only defeated 2/3 ships, or because I was at Lv.35.By the way, at the end of the battle I had 40 experience and 40 fame. |
