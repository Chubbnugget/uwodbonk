# Quest [Forbidden Seas]

### Quest [Forbidden Seas] Details

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Forbidden Seas |

### Quest Contents
You're the navigator who investigated the rumors about the ghost ship earlier. I was curious about your report, so I did some research and found that there are quite a few merchant ships that have mysteriously disappeared in the waters around here. It's a ridiculous story, but I can't just leave it alone. Find the rumored ship and subdue it!

| **Notes** | 1. Santo Domingo Tavern Sailor 2. North Atlantic Sea Area Subjugate the "Fleet of the Dead" off the coast of the Azores south (14750,3400) Ghost ships x 10 (regardless of solo or fleet) Skills used: Rapid fire/piercing If you are aiming for capture and capture, you can use planted bombs. In the case of melee, you will always recover completely if you reduce the number of enemy sailors, so it is impossible. Roaring bullets are invalid. However, roaring mines are effective. If you use magical attack items such as engravings, the durability and sailors of all friendly ships will receive large reflected damage, so be careful. Sun's amulet, Anubis' ankh, Jaguar god's curse mirror, etc. are not effective. Required 20,000 battle reputations. One of the three villainous maritime quests, still able to deal with it compared to the other two. Currently, it is often used to improve hand-to-hand combat and gunpowder skills. (The so-called Azosk, it seems that at least being able to ride the Knights of Malta Galley is a condition) |
