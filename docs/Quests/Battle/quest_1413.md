| **Quest Name** | Proud New Ship |

### Quest Contents
This is unusual, but it seems like I've received a request from the boss of the shipyard. It's about subjugating pirates, but I wonder why the shipyard would make such a request again... Well, it would be faster to ask the client directly. If you can do it, please go and talk to the shipyard master.
