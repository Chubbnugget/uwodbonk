Coordinates around 2600, 4900 (prepare when you see the islet) 12/18 Directly from Calicut, encounter in the northeast of the islet For some reason it has an Ottoman Turkish flag, but defeating it has no effect on hostility It is an islet on the in-game map, but it is actually an archipelago Bonus quest Wednesday |
