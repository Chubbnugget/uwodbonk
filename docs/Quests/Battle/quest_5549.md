| **Notes** | North-northeast of Edinburgh Orkney Pirates (near 16338.1932, 1 pinnace and 2 flutes) Skills used: Ballistics, rapid fire, repair *Oldest Revolver is included in the memorial album "New Age of Weapons" After the battle, get Earth Spirit Engraving, Artillery Knowledge, Aquavit (10) (random) I couldn't get it even after using over 200 pieces of mediation. (Have learned Dutch and German) Fame 19880 There seems to be some kind of prerequisite question or condition. ↓ Even if I didn't have both languages, I could get it with 10 recruitment letters (300,000 battle fame). I was able to have a conversation with the stage bonus gold, but the quest screen displayed that I didn't have the language, and even when I accepted the quest, a message that required skills were missing was displayed properly. In addition, I was able to introduce non-war warehouse characters (10 adventures, 48 exchanges, 0 battles, and a total of 19 Discovery in adventures excluding ports), so I don't think there is a prerequisite quest.I think fame is a condition for issuing the quest.It appeared with fame 150508. Fame came out in 20050. Probably 20,000↑ fame is a condition. ↓ Maritime Lv23, Battle Fame: 13230, Total Fame: 20,000, Trial version character without Dutch/German skills Can't take it a second time? During battle: Combat experience: 173, Loot: 11,100D (2 enemy ships (sunken/captured)) When reporting: Combat experience: 198, Reward: 26,400D Bonus quest Monday |
