| **Quest Name** | Signs of rising feces prices |

### Quest Contents
I received a request from the owner of a trading post in this town. There's something I'd like you to find out about horses. But, I wonder if this is my job... Could you meet me in person? If possible, I'd like to hear why you asked us to do it. I have to turn down jobs that are not related to this guild.
