| **Notes** | 1. Rio de Janeiro maritime request intermediary 2. Battle off the east coast of Bahia Fixed 10 marauders? (At the beginning of the battle, the log displayed 4 super frigates, 2 heavy frigates, and 2 large galleons, but I didn't have time to count them to see if there were 10 or not.) The number of ships destroyed to complete the quest is 5 (you must sink at least 5 ships including the flagship to clear the battle. If you sink just one flagship, the battle will be won, but the quest will remain uncompleted.) It was easier to use melee, but since you will be surrounded, you will receive a critical hit with a high probability. I was able to defeat them with hand-to-hand combat by using mines and avoiding critical hits as much as possible, but I lost several times until I got the hang of it. |
