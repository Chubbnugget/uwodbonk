| **Notes** | 1.Banker Battle in the Azores, North Atlantic (14220.3486). Heavy galleon 4, large galleon 2, battle galleon 4 Ram → melee encirclement & target for chestnuts, so if you're solo, if you get caught, it's almost over. However, the armor is poor, so if you can maintain medium range, you can win. You can easily win with solo melee. Once you string it in, it will come close to you, so you won't be afraid of rams, and shelling won't hurt. Artillery skills (using flame bullets) Rapid fire, ballistics Bonus quest Friday |
