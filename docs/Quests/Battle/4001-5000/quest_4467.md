| **Notes** | On the north side of Cape Lopez, southeast of Sao Tome, you will encounter 4 to 6 commercial carracks in solo mode right in front of Sao Tome. Melee skills use defense. Quest exclusively for privateer pirates. The bullets they use are probably grape bullets. When all 6 ships were sunk by Lv22 bombardment, I got 445 experience points even as a warrant officer. 2015/5/10 |
