### Quest Contents
This is a request to subdue pirates rampaging in the waters near Jamaica and Santiago. They seem to be in a fleet of four Galleon-type ships. Well, with your arm, I don't think you have anything to worry about...but don't let your guard down, okay? However... recently, thieves have been active...

If you sink a total of 4 ships, the quest will be cleared. The bombardment is weak, but they use grape bullets. Be careful as there is a ram attack. Additional quest for Santo Domingo: If all 4 ships are sunk by shelling or mines, gain 576 battle experience/62 fame. (Our maritime level is 48) |
