### Quest Contents
You did a great job subjugating the Salinas gang. Unfortunately, however, the outflow of weapons is not stopping and is increasing. It seems that their boss, Salinas, has teamed up with a smuggler to purchase a large amount of weapons. If we don't stop him, the situation won't improve... Can I ask you to subdue him?
