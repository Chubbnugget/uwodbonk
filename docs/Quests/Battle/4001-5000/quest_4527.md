| **Quest Name** | Yucatan Strait Blockade |

### Quest Contents
Exploration of the new continent is still a project in the future, but there are people who are trying to discourage it. Apparently there are pirates blocking the western channel of Jamaica. I don't know the details of the situation here. Go ask a Jamaican town official for details. It's going to be a long trip. Be very careful

Battle in the Yucatan Strait west of Jamaica Subjugation Target: Yucatan Strait Blockade Fleet (solo: 4-6 heavy carracks, fleet: 10 ships) Encounter point: Captured near the midway between the western tip of the island where Havana is located and the South American continent Artillery skills: Ballistics, rapid fire, repair Melee skills: None (with surgery) Melee attack power around 100 You can use artillery fire or hand-to-hand combat, but since there are so many sailors, hand-to-hand combat will take time. Since the turning is slow, it is easy to hit critical targets with artillery fire. Mines are also very effective because they move in groups. 4 ships appear (solo) Reward for sinking all 8400D + 221000D Bonus Quest Saturday |
