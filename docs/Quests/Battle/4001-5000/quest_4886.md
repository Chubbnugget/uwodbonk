| **Notes** | The strong enemy is an armored ship of the line, which has a durability of about 1200 and can be bombarded very painfully. It also uses mines, and its melee skills are weak, but it uses melee skills. Since it is a side-sailing ship, the ship's speed will drop due to headwinds, so if you take a distance from the windward, it will be equipped with a bow gun. The bow will be pointed, so it is recommended to aim for the bow chest and sink it. If you are solo, it is recommended to aim when there is only one ship. 海事経験値89,850.報酬8.985M。 It took 4 hours Experience points 134,775 (100% increase), Fame 22,535 (50% increase), Reward 16,472,500. @ Necafe Bonus Quest Friday |
