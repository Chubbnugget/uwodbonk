### Quest Contents
Until very recently, a gang of smugglers was gaining traction around here. Apparently, when the officials cracked down on them, they managed to escape to Celebes Island. I heard that he is currently being hidden by the Tochi bandits who have colluded with them. They subdued about 10 of those bandits and exposed them.
