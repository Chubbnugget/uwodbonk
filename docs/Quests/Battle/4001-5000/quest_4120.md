### Details of the quest [Navigator, hone your skills]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Navigator, sharpen your skills |

### Quest Contents
Are you confident in your combat skills on land? Even though you are a sailor, there are times when such strength is required. If you want to acquire that power but don't have the confidence, the Maritime Guild will arrange a suitable request for you. For now, I'd like to hear from the maritime guild master in this city. At the suggestion of the maritime guild master, I undertook the subjugation of the Cyprus remnants that were attacking caravans on the outskirts of Jaffa. The guild master says that subjugating this for the sake of the caravan will also be for his own benefit. Prepare well and take on the challenge with courage.
