| **Notes** | 1.Tavern Master 2.Urubamba River Bandit Subjugation (Lima North) The subjugation target is Urubamba River Bandit Lv40 x 15. Basically, it comes as a set with Conqueror Lv35, so it will be difficult if you don't have the strength to subdue both of them. The level of both the conqueror and the NPC to be subdued is low, and neither attack nor defense are high, so unless you are attacked by the rare bounty head level 55, there is almost no danger. There are several places where you can compete against opponents depending on your standing position (where conquerors won't come in), so it's easy to aim for them. |
