| **Quest Name** | The truth behind the loud noise |

### Quest Contents
Lately, I've been hearing a lot of explosions in the middle of the night, but could you please find out what's behind it? It's so noisy that I can't even sleep quietly. According to my preliminary research, it appears to be coming from the port. This is a request from the royal castle, please do a thorough investigation!
