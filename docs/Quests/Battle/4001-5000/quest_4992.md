### Quest Contents
Unfortunately, the situation in Merida is not improving. It seems like weapons keep coming out one after another. If we don't patiently continue to subjugate them, we won't be able to solve this problem... I want you to subdue 15 people again. As soon as you're ready, head to the outskirts of Merida.
