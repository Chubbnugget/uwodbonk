| **Quest Name** | Treasure Island |

### Quest Contents
Not only can you get gold dust in San Juan, but you can also get coral in the surrounding sea. You could even call it a treasure island. That's why many trading ships stop by, and there are also many pirate ships targeting them. This time, I want you to subdue that pirate. Please try to gather information in San Juan before heading out to subdue him.

Third island from the north southeast of San Juan (PF St. Lucia Island), battle with Martinique pirates around the north of the island - Artillery skills (flame bullets) Rapid fire, ballistics - Hand-to-hand skills? ? ? * Prefers close combat and repairs infrequently, so I don't think you will have much trouble in artillery battles. However, the firing range is long, so be careful of what's behind you. Since the number of sailors is small at 80, it would be a good idea to engage in hand-to-hand combat. *Battle LV 57: 4 ships sunk, combat experience 277, battle fame: 117 *Not good for high-level people Combat LV 28: 4 ships sunk, battle experience: 589, fame: 125 Experience when reporting: 182 Fame: 65 Combat Lv 52: 4 ships sunk Combat experience: 559 Fame: 117 Experience when reporting: 182 Fame: 65 Large galleons 4-6 ships Bonus quest Monday |
