| **Notes** | Basra Departure port official → Rest stop owner Ras Tanura Pirates (4 to 6 Galeas when solo) Skills used: Rowing, coming alongside, evasion Melee: Assault, shooting, defense, tactics Assault near Bahrain Island, just southeast of Basra. If you go over land from Basra, you will start surrounded. About 225 melee. Although it is active in melee combat, it moves slowly, so it destroys its entourage with its bow chestnut while cutting it down with mines. Do whatever you like with the remaining flagships. ↑I did it recently, and it moves quickly. ↑They can be caught even from a distance, and while they are caught you can use the BOX type to attack them. Once hand-to-hand combat begins, they will swarm you. If your evasion/armor is low, you will be dropped by melee. (I don't really recommend solo combat for melee) |
