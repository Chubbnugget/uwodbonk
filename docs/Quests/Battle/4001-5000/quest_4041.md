### Quest Contents
It's hard! A military ship that sailed from this city to Alexandria is attacked by pirates. Warships are ships that transport Janissaries. Since the Janissaries are an infantry unit, they have no chance of winning in naval battles... But why do pirates attack military ships? Please investigate that area and head to the rescue of the warships.

| **Notes** | After collecting information from the departure port officials and soldiers (both near the port and in no particular order), a battle took place north of Alexandria (1300, 3440). Solo: 6 battle carracks (maybe 4-6) 6 ships out, 4 sunk by gunfire, when capturing the flagship 250 experience points, 30 fame, 17670 spoils (no capture) Reward for dropping 5 ships is 98000D. 105,000D for 6 ships. At battle level 19, I sank 6 ships with artillery fire and received 356 experience points, 37 fame, and 21,762 spoils, and at the time of reporting, I got 90 experience points, 37 fame, and 105,000 rewards. Boros Pirates: Combat Carrack Durability 240, Sailors 55 (2 ships have 55 people, 2 ships have 50 people) Skills used: Ballistics, Repair, Surgery (hand-to-hand skills, no items) *Encountered on the 4th after resupplying in Athens and leaving port (just before Alec). After the start, the sail was damaged at a long distance with the enemy, and there was flooding at a medium distance. Are chain bullets also used because it doesn't reduce durability too much? The contents included 3 spare sails, 2 pails, 2 commands, and 2 rescues (2 materials consumption, 4 ammunition consumption, even returning the sailors by rescuing them). ←When armored with Aragare iron plate It feels the same as the convoy from Tunis. I'm disappointed that 18 people were shaken by the Daisho character. 2007/5/03 Even the large exploration carrack was shaken. We lost 20 people, so we hired as many people as we could. |
