### Quest Contents
You did a great job subjugating the Valverde family. As a result of the investigation, we found out the whereabouts of their leader. It seems to live in ruins deep inland south of Veracruz. If we gather information in Veracruz, we should be able to find out his weaknesses. It's okay, I'm sure you can subdue it with your skills!

If the defense power in battle is 275, the damage from the rear guard's gun is 1, and the damage from Valverde is about 10 to 20. Since confusion items are often used, it is best not to expect too much from FA. You can also enter the Mayan Lowlands with the "Notorious Family", so either Star Wars or the Notorious Family is fine. |
