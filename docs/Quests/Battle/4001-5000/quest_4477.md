| **Notes** | * Attack NPC Rakkar in the Western Caribbean and sink 15 ships. It's annoying that you have to chase them around because they don't attack you from the other side. Your quota will decrease by the number of ships you sink, so it's best to sink 3 ships. **It attacked us from the other side.*Isn't the number of Ruckers decreasing after Rafflo? Although we searched around Havana for over three hours, we were only able to meet twice. Certainly difficult to discover. I saw it for the first time late at night in front of Havana. **There are many in the southwestern part of Havana. **They are between Havana and Portobello. **When we can't meet, we can't meet. Bad original quest. LV33 Solo bombardment/sunk 3 ships with mines only, experience points 428, fame 63, battle galleon x3, admiral, endurance 588, sailor 72, bonus quest Saturday |
