### Quest Contents
Along the coast east of this city are large cities such as Genoa and Pisa. Therefore, of course, many commercial ships pass through this area. There are pirates out there who are targeting it, but can I ask you to subdue them? This is a good opportunity to go to Genoa and ask questions.
