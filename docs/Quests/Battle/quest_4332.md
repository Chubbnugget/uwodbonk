| **Quest Name** | Breakaway force plan |

### Quest Contents
After the recent naval battle, Pizarro's activities ceased. However, there are rumors that the rough-and-tumble men who broke up with Pizarro are planning something sinister. I would like to find out the true nature of this rumor and ask for subjugation if necessary. Apparently there is a soldier in Lambayeque who has left the army. Please try to contact me
