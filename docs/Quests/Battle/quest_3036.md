### Quest Contents
Would you be willing to take on the task of securing a route for trading ships? If the ship were attacked frequently, you wouldn't be able to move around freely. Well, I'd like you to punish the merchant ship raiding parties near the shipping route a little. If you hit about 12 ships, they should become quiet.
