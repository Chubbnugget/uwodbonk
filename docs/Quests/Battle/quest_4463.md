| **Quest Name** | Crackdown on privateer fleets |  

### Quest Contents
Apparently there is a lot of damage from piracy around the Java Sea these days. Merchant ships sailing to and from the Spice Islands are having their cargo stolen by the Mataram privateer fleet. Even the Maritime Guild is having trouble with this matter. That's why I would like you to lend me your strength. They destroyed 13 ships and suppressed their activities.

| **Notes** | The Mataram privateer fleet often spawns in the waters between Jakarta and Surabaya.The bombardment is painful, but the bow cannons tend to point the bow, making it easy to aim at the bow chestnut.They always come out in groups of two, so you have to fight at least seven times. |
