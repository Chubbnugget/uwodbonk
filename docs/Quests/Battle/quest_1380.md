### Details of the quest [Antwerp Blockade]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | blockade of antwerp |

### Quest Contents
I'm sure you all know that there are various things going on between the Netherlands and Spain, but I'm wondering if it has something to do with it or not, and there's a bit of a problem going on. Right next to the city of Antwerp, ships trying to enter the port are being attacked one after another. Listen to the story at Heldel's departure point.
