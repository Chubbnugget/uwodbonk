### Quest Contents
A request for subjugation came from the Manila port official. It seems that a raiding fleet disguised as a fishing boat appears on the eastern side of Luzon Island, where Manila is located. Many ships lost their cargo there. If you have any skills, could you please lend me your strength? I heard the details from a port official in Manila.
