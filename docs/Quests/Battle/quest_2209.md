# Quest [Unidentified Fleet]


### Quest [Unidentified Fleet] Details

| Attribute | Details |  
| :--- | :--- |  
| **Quest Name** | Unidentified Fleet |  

### Quest Contents
There have been reports of a pirate fleet gathering off the coast south of Abidjan. The number and size of the ships seems to be quite large, but there doesn't seem to be any sign of them moving. That's an important trade route. I want them to be defeated before the ship is attacked. First, try searching for information at the bars in this town.
