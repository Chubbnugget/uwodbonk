Battle with Portuguese Navy rebel soldiers (4-6 light galleons when solo, 10 when in a two-person fleet) in the southwest of Mozambique (just before the landing point on the southeast coast of Africa) Near coordinates (1800,5400) Skills used: Eraside, Evasion, Defense, Tactics, Rarely Assault The enemy's firing range is quite short. Normal bullets (using Rapids?) will hit you in the head, so it's easy. If you sail too far offshore when searching for an enemy, you'll pass by and go all the way to Sofala. |
