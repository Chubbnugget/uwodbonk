### Quest [Knights of Rhodes] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Knights of Rhodes |

### Quest Contents
This is the first time since the country's direct response. The men who call themselves the Knights of Rhodes seem to be blocking the sea route with their stronghold on the island of Rhodes northeast of Candia. This is an important route from Istanbul to Beirut. I would like your support in lifting the lockdown here. Please ask the Maritime Guild Master for details.
