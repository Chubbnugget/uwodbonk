| **Notes** | If you go to the bottom of Holo, there will be a Bugis assault fleet, so you will mainly hunt them. We recommend nearby Holo for supplies (no problem if you take a special transport ship to the command center), and use the amulet when reporting. The strong enemy is Heavy Galeas, a melee AI that will attack you. The ship speed is fast and troublesome. 1-2 ships in solo mode, more in fleet. Be careful as it is hard and you will have to fight continuously with melee. Bonus Quest Wednesday |
