### Details of the quest [Extermination of warehouse raiders]

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quest Name** | Eliminate warehouse robbers |

### Quest Contents
It was a request from the departure port official. It seems that thieves have taken advantage of the darkness to attack warehouses at the port, and have taken away materials. It has caused damage many times already, so I hope they can get rid of it somehow. Ask for details directly from the client and do your best.
