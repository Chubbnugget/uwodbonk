### Details of the quest [An unexpected new route]

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | An unexpected new route |

### Quest Contents
I have an interesting request, would you be willing to accept it? It is said that the port official in this city has discovered a sea route to India that is unknown elsewhere. I'm confident that if I use that, I'll definitely make a lot of money. Does such a thing really exist? Anyway, please just listen to me.
