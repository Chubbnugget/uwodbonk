### Quest [Great Pirate Siege] Details

| Attribute | Details |

| **Quest Name** | Great Pirate Siege |  

### Quest Contents
The unknown raiders you defeated in the Caribbean before, but I've discovered their leader. There is no doubt that it is the infamous great pirate François Roronois. Currently, he is carrying out a strategy to subjugate Roronoa based in Jamaica. As this is a large-scale subjugation operation, naval combat skills are required. Please approach with care.

| **Notes** | Jamaica City Official x 2 Captured "Roronoa's men" around the island northeast of Santiago. Target subjugated 15 heavy galleons (4-6 in solo, 10 in fleet). Bombardment is painful and easy to confuse, armor is high, critical hits are difficult to hit, and melee value is around 260. If you're playing solo, it's best to use the navy as a shield. It will probably sink soon, but if you want to make sure you're going, it's better to use a large fleet reinforcement with a letter of appreciation from the navigator.Also, since it's an information acquisition system, if you receive it with a fleet, you can fight consecutive battles from Jamaica. Use normal bullets |
