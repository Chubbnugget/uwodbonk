### Quest [Blank Sea Area] Details

| **Quest Name** | Blank Sea Area |

### Quest Contents
I've got a request. There is a pirate base on the coast of North Africa, east of Tripoli. I want you to subjugate the fleet protecting that base. That area is far away from any city, so it seems like it's not well monitored. Well, it's a request that you can handle without any problem. Don't worry
