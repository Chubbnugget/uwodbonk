| **Quest Name** | Kidnapping |

### Quest Contents
I've received a very strange request from a city official in Ceylon. A while ago, there was an incident in which a girl from Ceylon was kidnapped, but a few days after she was kidnapped, she suddenly returned. Even so, it seems that the criminals continue to make demands for money and goods. Please ask the Ceylon city officials for details.
