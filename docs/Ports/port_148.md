### Description
In the southeastern hinterland of Veracruz, there is a diner owner in place of the Tavern Master, the capital of the Aztec Empire. It is a capital built on an island in the center of Lake Texcoco, and the sight of three bridges extending to the shore is magnificent. Cortés also wrote in his report, ``It is so vast and beautiful that I will only report on half of it.''
