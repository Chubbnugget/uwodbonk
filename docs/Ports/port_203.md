### Description
The capital of the legendary land of Atlantis. It is an impregnable fortified city with a circular structure, surrounded by canals, and protected by high walls. There is also a warehouse guard and a temple (Temple of Poseidon). Traveling on the Ship of the Sun Secret Quest [2015/12/3 Phone@Administrator] For convenience, the icon on the map has been set at the same location as Candia. Also, since you can receive imperial command quests from Sokoban, there is a "middleman" for the sake of the quest database.
